## Lesson129 Nothing in Common
> Thinking of things to do with my friends takes no effort at all. However, when it comes to doing things with my girlfriend. it is difficult to decide what to do. She and I have very different interests. For example, I like to play sports and go to the movies. She likes to go to night clubs and KTVs. We have been seeing each other for a few months now, but I am not sure how long this will last. It is important for a couple to have something in common if they are to stay together for a long time. I love my girlfriend very much, but I do not share her interests, nor does she enjoy doing what I do. If I asked her to play basketball with me at the part, she would not go. We shou find time to talk about our differences. Maybe we should end our relationship.

## Lesson130 Recycling

An old piece of paper can then be turned into a newpager or magazne, A glass bottle that was once used to hold water can be used to make windows or other things.

## Lesson131 Australia Is worth Visiting
> Some people consider Australia the world's largest island, but others call it the world's smallest continent. No matter how you look at it, thought, Australia is a very special place.
> Australians live mostly in the country's five or six largest cities. Not very many people live in the countryside. One reason for this is that, like in other countries, it is easier to find good schools and jobs in cities than in the countryside. Another reason may be that parts of Australiaa are difficult to live in. Most of the country is desert and some of it is even tropical jungle. Therefore, most of Australia's citizens prefer living in big cities near the ocean.
> Australia offers many natural wonders. Special animals like koalas and kangaroos are pupular with tourists. Australia has someting for everyone, so it's a grate place to visit!

## Lesson132 Life-saving Cell Phones
> I think my cell phone is the most important invention in my life. I did not think it would save a life, but I was wrong. Last week, I was leaving a convenience store when I heard a loud noise. I looked up as a bus driver stepped on his brakes. Untortunately, the bus had been speeding, and it hit a dog that was in the middle of the street. The dog yelped one time before it fell down. People looked up to see what had happened, but no one tried to help the poor dog. I took my cell phone out of my backpack. I dialed 110 as quickly as I could. I told the police what had happened. and they sent a vet to the rescue. Luckily, the dog's lift was saved. Cell phones truly are life-saving inventions.

## Lesson133 Be Careful, Motorists
> We're supposed to look both ways before crossing a street, even when the light is green. Every person knows this, but monkeys don't. In Hong Kong, a member of a group of monkeys ran out onto a road and was hit by a 45-year-old female motorist. The woman did not stop to assist the injured monkey. The other monkeys in the group somehow stoped traffic and helped pull the hurt monkey to the side of the road. Sadly, however, the monkey later died of injuries.

Countries are even beginning to see a drop in population because of it.

When he said this, I sat up in the bed. I couldn't believe it. How could this happen? He couldn'tget married first. It wasn't fair. "How long have you known this girl?"

One morning, during her walk to the river, she met a man. He was tall, thin and very kind. He smiled at her and said, "I will give you one wish if you give me a bite of your breakfast." The girl gave the man a piece of her bread and then she asked to meet a handsome prince and live happily ever after. As soon as she made her wish, the man turned into a gorgeous prince. The girl was so happy, but then she woke up and relized it was only a dream.
