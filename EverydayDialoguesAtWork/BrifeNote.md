Yes ,today's my first day, I was transfered from the Shanghai ofice.    
we are in top-notch condition at the moment. I like to think that's partly my influence!    
I did hear there had been some lay-offs.     
I started off in the Shenzhen office about 6 years ago    
I always know what you mean. I don't mean in that way, besides, she's older than me.    
Get your mind out of the gutter!     
she's my superior. We chatted about loads of stuff.    
From a socialising point of view I agree. There's alwasys something going on in Beijing, 24/7.    
Is this seat taken?    
it would be nice to have some company,    
I don't like the cafeteria food in the company.    
I can't stand the food here either.    
there's no rule against eating at you desk.     
I know which sandwich place you mean and I really fancy one of their meatball subs!    
Your presentation was excellent. I really envy you.    
It's always a blow when a good customer goes to one of your competitors.    
we always seem to be behind schedule because we are always chasing something which should have already been completed.    
What do think the problem is? Logistics?    
I think it's a employee problem. Maybe we aren't selective enough when we hire new staff.    
Have you thought of implementing a training scheme? Make it compulsory,    
that's easy to see from your figures.     
We believe in training, in-house and ongoing.     
whatever field you are in, we all contribute to the success of the company.    
Did it ever occur to you that she likes you.    
Why doesn't she pick on the others?    
you are kind of shy, but still Very approachable.     
Her job is more concerned with sales.    
Don't forget you are linked to sales in some respects.    
Why not ask her to lunch?     
have you found your feet, yet?    
Beijing Is certainly different to Langfang, which is after all a tiny place.    
How long were you at Langfang branch?    
Are you experiencing culture shock in any way?    
I had a hard time getting used to the food.     
it turned out weirdly,    
No serious communication problems. But after work, communicating with the locals is pretty tough. I'm not used to such a strong accent.    
everyday conversations     
I especially need to work on my beijing accent.    
You mean before I sign? Go ahead.    
Firstly, you will be paid monthly, paid directly into your bank account. You will be given one month of holiday after one year of service.    
any long term illness would be covered by insurance.    
you can see from my reference from my former boss. I didn't have many sick days.    
your employment record is extremely good.     
you need to be available outside office hours.    
I see. When exactly? Am I going to be on call 24 hours a day?    
We don't work you that hard.    
That sounds fine. You did scare me for a minute though.    
Enough about my day. How was your day?    
he is old enough to be my dad    
he seems to be a really nice guy.    
Did he go into any details about your working hours?    
It's not at all bad. Not like the last company.    
So go on. enlighten me.    
just in case something important came in.    
Do they have any openings for secretaries.    
I will check it out for you    
I'll really owe you one.    
So, Spring, what we like to push here is teamwork.     
I think there should be a high emphasis on teamwork.    
I don't want you to worry too much about formalities. We like to have a relaxed working environment.    
Such a breath of fresh air.    
Everyone seemed old and stuffy. Even if they were only my age.    
Well, this is definitely not the kind of environment we want to cultivate.     
thank you so much for taking the trouble to talk to me.    
So you're big on company bonding. then?    
we don't go in for forced company bonding    
No one is frowned upon.     
Sometimes it's pretty impromptu,    
we organize a getaway to a ranch just outside of Beijing.    
Fabulous. I'm certainly looking forward to that.    
Most people we deal with here are foreigners.  
Do you have any special rules here for making phone calls in English?  
You mean like etiqutte? Yes, there are some guidelines. But they aren't set in stone.  
We should always begin with a salutation, like "What's up?".  
I think "What's up?" is a little too informal.  
How silly of me.  
It is acceptable to say either Mr Shi or Hans Shi.  
if you are not professional on the phone, or sound unenthusiastic or indifferent, they won't want to deal with you.  
They may just hang-up on you.  
I had better start practicing. I never realised the style of a phone call could be so important.  
I siscovered i suck on the phone.  
You are always chatting on the phone to your mates.  
No i mean at work. Apparently, I have been making some big mistakes.  
It turns out that I'm not polite enough.  
Over at the bank we have to be incredibly polite.  
You are trying to break into the foreign market, aren't you?  
That's basically how my colleague put it. I think i need to brush up on my phone etiqutte.  
They are tricky to deal with. You just have to remember to bow and be super polite.  
Could you  put me through to Mr Atkins, please?  
I was hoping to speak to Mr Atkins, please.  
Does he know what this is regarding?  
he is expecting my call.  
Bet you have a big date or something ... or maybe a facial...    
We need to go over the final details.   
As if I haven't told you them a million times already....  
He is out of office  
You could try on your way to the airport tomorrow.  
Have you considered Amy?  
She is older and more experenced.  
Your flight is due in at 6 pm.   
I've made a note of everything.  
We are going to be very busy after you seal the deal.  
Don't even ask  
he is just so infuriating.  
try to calm down  
The one you have been planning for him for ages?   
But you sorted this entire thing out for him long ago, didn't you?  
But he just doesn't seem to think I'm capable of doing anything.He couldn't function without you.  
Now I know how Mr wu is hard to deal with, I used to be below him so I know how he treats women. 
I have no complaints.  
Pull the other one! I don't like dishonesty.  
Go on dear, let it all out.  
I don't particularly enjoy working with him.I guarantee things will be better around here.  
There is a big pile of photocopying.
I think one of the general assistants can handle that, don't you?  
Let's go down to the coffee shop and get to know one another a little better.  
I could kill for a coffee and a cake.  
Dealing with Criticism. Expect it, Examine it, Endure it.
