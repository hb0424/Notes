Yes ,today's my first day, I was transfered from the Shanghai ofice.  
we are in top-notch condition at the moment. I like to think that's partly my influence!  
I did hear there had been some lay-offs.   
I started off in the Shenzhen office about 6 years ago  
I always know what you mean. I don't mean in that way, besides, she's older than me.  
Get your mind out of the gutter!   
she's my superior. We chatted about loads of stuff.  
From a socialising point of view I agree. There's alwasys something going on in Beijing, 24/7.  
Is this seat taken?  
it would be nice to have some company,  
I don't like the cafeteria food in the company.  
I can't stand the food here either.  
there's no rule against eating at you desk.   
I know which sandwich place you mean and I really fancy one of their meatball subs!  
Your presentation was excellent. I really envy you.  
It's always a blow when a good customer goes to one of your competitors.  
we always seem to be behind schedule because we are always chasing something which should have already been completed.  
What do think the problem is? Logistics?  
I think it's a employee problem. Maybe we aren't selective enough when we hire new staff.  
Have you thought of implementing a training scheme? Make it compulsory,  
that's easy to see from your figures.   
We believe in training, in-house and ongoing.   
whatever field you are in, we all contribute to the success of the company.  
Did it ever occur to you that she likes you.  
Why doesn't she pick on the others?  
you are kind of shy, but still Very approachable.   
Her job is more concerned with sales.  
Don't forget you are linked to sales in some respects.  
Why not ask her to lunch?   
have you found your feet, yet?  
Beijing Is certainly different to Langfang, which is after all a tiny place.  
How long were you at Langfang branch?  
Are you experiencing culture shock in any way?  
I had a hard time getting used to the food.   
it turned out weirdly,  
No serious communication problems. But after work, communicating with the locals is pretty tough. I'm not used to such a strong accent.  
everyday conversations   
I especially need to work on my beijing accent.  
You mean before I sign? Go ahead.  
Firstly, you will be paid monthly, paid directly into your bank account. You will be given one month of holiday after one year of service.  
any long term illness would be covered by insurance.  
you can see from my reference from my former boss. I didn't have many sick days.  
your employment record is extremely good.   
you need to be available outside office hours.  
I see. When exactly? Am I going to be on call 24 hours a day?  
We don't work you that hard.  
That sounds fine. You did scare me for a minute though.  
Enough about my day. How was your day?  
he is old enough to be my dad  
he seems to be a really nice guy.  
Did he go into any details about your working hours?  
It's not at all bad. Not like the last company.  
So go on. enlighten me.  
just in case something important came in.  
Do they have any openings for secretaries.  
I will check it out for you  
I'll really owe you one.  
So, Spring, what we like to push here is teamwork.   
I think there should be a high emphasis on teamwork.  
I don't want you to worry too much about formalities. We like to have a relaxed working environment.  
Such a breath of fresh air.  
Everyone seemed old and stuffy. Even if they were only my age.  
Well, this is definitely not the kind of environment we want to cultivate.   
thank you so much for taking the trouble to talk to me.  
So you're big on company bonding. then?  
we don't go in for forced company bonding  
No one is frowned upon.   
Sometimes it's pretty impromptu,  
we organize a getaway to a ranch just outside of Beijing.  
Fabulous. I'm certainly looking forward to that.
