> A: Ah, that explains why I hadn't heard we were getting a new colleague, we are in different departments.  
> G: So, how's this office doing?  
> A: Well, we are in top-notch condition at the moment. I like to think that's partly my influence!  
> G: Good, good, Unfortunately,  the Shanghai office isn't doing too well, I was lucky to be sent here.  
> A: Yes, I did hear there had been some lay-offs. Your job is safe here, as I said we are doing really well.  
> G: It's good to know. How long have you been working here?  
> A: Actually, I started off in the Shenzhen office about 6 years ago, but I've been here for 2. How about you?  
> G: I've been with them for about 2 years. I feel it's a good company to work for, and the money's not bad.  

## Dialogue 2
Chatting about Meeting New People (At home in boys' apartment)  
> Hans: So, Gao. How was you first day?  
> Gao Shan: Pretty good. I met a really nice lady called Alice.

> G: Yes, she's Chinese. She's just really friendly and down to earth.  
> H: How friendly? You know, some of the girls in my office are really friendly! You know what I mean?  
> G: Yes, I always know what you mean. I don't mean in that way, besides, she's older than me.  
> H: Age is good. It means experence.  
> G: Get your mind out of the gutter! She's a nice lady and was helpful today, plus she's my superior. We chatted about loads of stuff.  
> H: Yeah, yeah. Boring stuff I bet! Seriously, do you think you will be happier here than in Shanghai?  
> G: To be honest it's a little too early to say. I mean, today was just my first day.
> H: I think you're gonna love it! Beijing is a cool place, better than Shanghai if you ask me.  
> G: From a socialising point of view I agree. There's alwasys something going on in Beijing, 24/7.  

## Dialogue 3
Meeting Some for the Second Time(Gao Shan meets Alice again in the company cafeteria)  
> Gao Shan: Hello Alice. Nice to see you again, and so soon.  
> Alice: Hi there Gao Shan, yes it hasn't been long. Is this seat taken?  
> G: Yes, sure, please sit down. It would be nice to have some company, I don't know many people yet.  
> A: Don't worry, you'll make friends. I'll introduce you to some more people. You haven't got anything to eat, are you not felling well?  
> G: Well, to be honest, I don't like the cafeteria food in the company.  
> A: You may noticed I've only got an apple...  
> G: You are slim already, you don't need to diet!  
> A: No, no! Actually I'm not eating for the same reason as you; I can't stand the food here either.  
> G: Ha ha! I'm glad I'm not alone. Now, the Shanghai office, the food there was excellent. And because it was subsidised, it was so cheap. I don't know what kind of chefs they've got here.  
> A: Tell me about it! The Shenzhen office was much better than this, too. I'll have to get something from the shop.  
> G: Let me tell you a little secret, Usually, after my lunch break, I call the sandwich shop across the street and have something sent to my office. If the boss is around, I eat in the broom cupboard!  
> A: Oh dear! You don't have to hide it; you know there's no rule against eating at you desk. You know, if you feel like some company, maybe today I'll join you. I know which sandwich place you mean and I really fancy one of their meatball subs!  

# Making New Friends

## Dialogue 1
Work Assignments(At a meeting during the coffee break Sylvia has a conversation with colleague.)  
> Annabel: Your presentation was excellent. I really envy you.  
> Sylvia: Oh, oh, thank you? Why?
> A: Well, I noticed the great results you've got. The staff are outselling all of the other sales department in the Beijing area.  
> S: Yes I'm lucky we have a great team. But of course my main area is accounts. Your team were doing pretty well last year, what happened this year.  
> A: We've had some trouble with delivery dates. Often the orders are not on time, so some of our customers have changed supppliers.  
> S: It's always a blow when a good customer goes to one of your competitors.  
> A: So, we always seem to be behind schedule because we are always chasing something which should have already been completed.  
> S: What do think the problem is? Logistics?
> A: To be honest, I think it's a employee problem. Maybe we aren't selective enough when we hire new staff.
> S: Have you thought of implementing a training scheme? Make it compulsory, so no one can get out of it. Maybe then things will run better. Obviously, I don't really know too much about this.  
> A: Obviously you do. That's a really good idea. I mean, the people in your area are well trained, that's easy to see from your figures.
> S: We believe in training, in-house and ongoing. You can never learn too much, that's what I always say, whatever field you are in, we all contribute to the success of the company.

## Dialogue 2
Discussing a day's Work. (At home In the girl's apartment.)
> Sylvia: I hope you don't mind me bothering you, but I know you studied in England and to be honest,  I feel much more comfortable talking to you than the others.  
> Maggie: Sylvia, spit it out, You know I'm the apartment agony aunt, what seems to be the trouble?  
> S: Well, not trouble as such. You see there's a woman I work with, Annabel. She comes from England and she's always praising me.  
> M: Do you mean the weird one.  Who just transferred from the Langfang office.  
> S: Yes, anyway, she's not weird really. Just she hasn't been in China very long. And this is her first job here.  
> M: And.  
> S: She makes me uncomfortable. That's all. She's always praising me. And I don't really know why.  
> M: Did it ever occur to you that she likes you. Maybe she just wants someone to chat to.  
> S: Likes me. But why? I am nothing special. Why doesn't she pick on the others?  
> M: As you said, she is new here and you are kind of shy, but still Very approachable. Maybe she doesn't have many friends. I think it's just her way of being nice and friendly.  
> S: Do you really think so? I never thought of that. I mean, we aren't even really in the same department. Her job is more concerned with sales.  
> M: Don't forget you are linked to sales in some respects. Give her a break. Why not ask her to lunch? Come on. We can never have enough friends, no matter how weird and wonderful they are.  

##  Dialogue 3
Following up when you're being praised( Sylvia takes Maggie's advice and tries to get along with Annabel.)
> S: Annabel. Hi, how are you today? Still green with envy? Ha ha!  
> A: No, I have got over that. But maybe when I have to do a speech, you can give me a hand with it. Okay?  
> S: I'd love to. There is no problem. So have you found your feet, yet?  
> A: Yes, I'm doing fine. Thanks. Beijing Is certainly different to Langfang, which is after all a tiny place.  
> S: How long were you At long branch?  
> A: Just three months. So I haven't been in China very long. Everything is so fresh and new. So exciting.  
> S: Are you experiencing culture shock in any way?  
> A: A little. I had a hard time getting used to the food. Chinese food here is totally different from that in England.  
> S: How about your Chinese? I mean, I know you speak Chinese. but are you finding it difficult?  
> A: Well, to be honest, it turned out weirdly, not what I expected at all. Here in the office. I feel it's not too bad. No serious communication problems. But after work, communicating with the locals is pretty tough. I'm not used to such a strong accent.  
> S: Yes, that's true. Beijinger's do have a strong accent. But you get used to it after a while. It's probably the same thing with our English, what we learned at university and what we use in everyday conversations is totally different.  
> A: Tell you what? Let's work together on this. I'll give you a hand with your spoken English and you can help me with my everyday Chinese. I especially need to work on my beijing accent.  

# Employee Contracts

## Dialogue 1
Employee contracts. (Spring, who is a new member of staff, discusses her contract.)
> Mr Wilson: Please come in and take a seat. Miss Feng.  
> Spring: Thank you, sir. You wanted to discuss my contract?  
> W: Yes, I know that our employee officer over in HR has already given you some details about your contract. But i'd like to have a chat about the main point.  
> You mean before I sign? Go ahead.  
> Right? Firstly, you will be paid monthly, paid directly into your bank account. You will be given one month of holiday after one year of service.  
> Okay, great. The accounts department already had my bank details. I passed them on last time I was here.  
> Great. Also you will be covered by our medical plan. A few sick days will be covered by the company. But any long term illness would be covered by insurance.  
> Well, and you can see from my reference from my former boss. I didn't have many sick days.  
> Yes, your employment record is extremely good. And because you are going to be in charge of translating Important documents, you need to be available outside office hours.  
> Oh, I see. When exactly? Am I going to be on call 24 hours a day?  
> No, no. We don't work you that hard. You just need to be available for two hours after normal working hours, in case there is a emergency.  
> I see. That sounds fine. You did scare me for a minute though.

## Dialogue 2
Discussing new boss (at home in girl's apartment.)
> Spring: Hey, lulu, how was your day?  
> Lulu: Enough about my day. How was your day? Is the new boss a dishy American, ...tall, dark and...  
> S: Shut up. She is old enough to be my dad. Well, uncle anyway, actually, he seems to be a really nice guy.  
> L: That's good news. Did he go into any details about your working hours?  
> S: Yes, he did. It's not at all bad. Not like the last company.  
> L: See, I told you that working for a foreign company is the best.  Not that I'd Actually know. but a girl can dream. So go on. enlighten me.  
> S: Well, He said i'd have to be available for two hours after normal working time, just in case something important came in.  
> L: Is it all? And I guess you'll get paid for that, right? So unfair.  
> S: I know! Get out the violins, in your company, your work and work and work and never get paid a penny of overtime.  
> L: That's it. I'm definitely quitting now. Do they have any openings for secretaries.  
> S: Calm down. It's only my first week, but I will check it out for you. I know how unhappy you are in your current job.  
> L: Thanks. If you can find me something. I'll really owe you one.

## Dialogue 3
Having a chat with a Superior (Spring And Mr Wilson have a chat about company culture in the coffee shop.)
> Mr. Wilson: So, Spring, what we like to push here is teamwork. You know there is no I in team.  
> Spring: I agree. I think there should be a high emphasis on teamwork.  
> W: Also, I don't want you to worry too much about formalities. We like to have a relaxed working environment.  
> S: That's wonderful. Such a breath of fresh air. After my old job, everything was formal there. Absolutely everything. Everyone  seemed old and stuffy. Even if they were only my age.  
> W: Well, this is definitely not the kind of environment we want to cultivate. How have your first few days been? Any problems?  
> S: No nothing, nothing at all. I think I'm going to be happy here. And thank you so much for taking the trouble to talk to me.  
> W: Nonsense. I'm always welcoming to new staff members. We are like a family here and get together quite often.  
> S: So you're big on company bonding. then?  
> W: Too true. But we don't go in for forced company bonding. If you want to join us. Do So, if you don't, then don't. No one is frowned upon. We understand some people are too busy.  
> S: Well, that's just great. Tell me what do you usually I can't wait to join in.  
> W: Sometimes it's pretty impromptu, Like coming down here to the coffee shop. Also, usually in the summer, we organize a getaway to a ranch just outside of Beijing. Of course the company pays. We eat and drink lots, go swimming, horse riding, that sort of thing.  
> S: Fabulous. I'm certainly looking forward to that. I really think I'm going to enjoy working here.
