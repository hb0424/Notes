> G: Nice to meet you Alice, I'm Gao Shan. I'm in advertising.  
> A: Ah, that explains why I hadn't heard we were getting a new colleague, we are in different departments.  
> G: So, how's this office doing?  
> A: Well, we are in top-notch condition at the moment. I like to think that's partly my influence!  
> G: Good, good, Unfortunately,  the Shanghai office isn't doing too well, I was lucky to be sent here.  
> A: Yes, I did hear there had been some lay-offs. Your job is safe here, as I said we are doing really well.  
> G: It's good to know. How long have you been working here?  
> A: Actually, I started off in the Shenzhen office about 6 years ago, but I've been here for 2. How about you?  
> G: I've been with them for about 2 years. I feel it's a good company to work for, and the money's not bad.

> H: How friendly? You know, some of the girls in my office are really friendly! You know what I mean?  
> G: Yes, I always know what you mean. I don't mean in that way, besides, she's older than me.  
> H: Age is good. It means experence.  
> G: Get your mind out of the gutter! She's a nice lady and was helpful today, plus she's my superior. We chatted about loads of stuff.  
> H: Yeah, yeah. Boring stuff I bet! Seriously, do you think you will be happier here than in Shanghai?  
> G: To be honest it's a little too early to say. I mean, today was just my first day.
> H: I think you're gonna love it! Beijing is a cool place, better than Shanghai if you ask me.  
> G: From a socialising point of view I agree. There's alwasys something going on in Beijing, 24/7.  

## Dialogue 3
Meeting Some for the Second Time(Gao Shan meets Alice again in the company cafeteria)  
> Gao Shan: Hello Alice. Nice to see you again, and so soon.  
> Alice: Hi there Gao Shan, yes it hasn't been long. Is this seat taken?  
> G: Yes, sure, please sit down. It would be nice to have some company, I don't know many people yet.  
> A: Don't worry, you'll make friends. I'll introduce you to some more people. You haven't got anything to eat, are you not felling well?  
> G: Well, to be honest, I don't like the cafeteria food in the company.  
> A: You may noticed I've only got an apple...  
> G: You are slim already, you don't need to diet!  
> A: No, no! Actually I'm not eating for the same reason as you; I can't stand the food here either.  
> G: Ha ha! I'm glad I'm not alone. Now, the Shanghai office, the food there was excellent. And because it was subsidised, it was so cheap. I don't know what kind of chefs they've got here.  
> A: Tell me about it! The Shenzhen office was much better than this, too. I'll have to get something from the shop.  
> G: Let me tell you a little secret, Usually, after my lunch break, I call the sandwich shop across the street and have something sent to my office. If the boss is around, I eat in the broom cupboard!  
> A: Oh dear! You don't have to hide it; you know there's no rule against eating at you desk. You know, if you feel like some company, maybe today I'll join you. I know which sandwich place you mean and I really fancy one of their meatball subs!  

# Making New Friends

## Dialogue 1
Work Assignments(At a meeting during the coffee break Sylvia has a conversation with colleague.)  
> Annabel: Your presentation was excellent. I really envy you.  
> Sylvia: Oh, oh, thank you? Why?
> A: Well, I noticed the great results you've got. The staff are outselling all of the other sales department in the Beijing area.  
> S: Yes I'm lucky we have a great team. But of course my main area is accounts. Your team were doing pretty well last year, what happened this year.  
> A: We've had some trouble with delivery dates. Often the orders are not on time, so some of our customers have changed supppliers.  
> S: It's always a blow when a good customer goes to one of your competitors.  
> A: So, we always seem to be behind schedule because we are always chasing something which should have already been completed.  
> S: What do think the problem is? Logistics?
> A: To be honest, I think it's a employee problem. Maybe we aren't selective enough when we hire new staff.
> S: Have you thought of implementing a training scheme? Make it compulsory, so no one can get out of it. Maybe then things will run better. Obviously, I don't really know too much about this.  
> A: Obviously you do. That's a really good idea. I mean, the people in your area are well trained, that's easy to see from your figures.
> S: We believe in training, in-house and ongoing. You can never learn too much, that's what I always say, whatever field you are in, we all contribute to the success of the company.
