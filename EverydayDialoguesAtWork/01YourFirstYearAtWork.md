> G: It's good to know. How long have you been working here?  
> A: Actually, I started off in the Shenzhen office about 6 years ago, but I've been here for 2. How about you?

## Dialogue 3
Meeting Some for the Second Time(Gao Shan meets Alice again in the company cafeteria)  
> Gao Shan: Hello Alice. Nice to see you again, and so soon.  
> Alice: Hi there Gao Shan, yes it hasn't been long. Is this seat taken?  
> G: Yes, sure, please sit down. It would be nice to have some company, I don't know many people yet.  
> A: Don't worry, you'll make friends. I'll introduce you to some more people. You haven't got anything to eat, are you not felling well?  
> G: Well, to be honest, I don't like the cafeteria food in the company.  
> A: You may noticed I've only got an apple...  
> G: You are slim already, you don't need to diet!  
> A: No, no! Actually I'm not eating for the same reason as you; I can't stand the food here either.  
> G: Ha ha! I'm glad I'm not alone. Now, the Shanghai office, the food there was excellent. And because it was subsidised, it was so cheap. I don't know what kind of chefs they've got here.  
> A: Tell me about it! The Shenzhen office was much better than this, too. I'll have to get something from the shop.  
> G: Let me tell you a little secret, Usually, after my lunch break, I call the sandwich shop across the street and have something sent to my office. If the boss is around, I eat in the broom cupboard!  
> A: Oh dear! You don't have to hide it; you know there's no rule against eating at you desk. You know, if you feel like some company, maybe today I'll join you. I know which sandwich place you mean and I really fancy one of their meatball subs!
