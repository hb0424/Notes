> NARRATOR: Mike Davis and his sister Anita are talking about their company. What's going on at Accelerated English?  
> MIKE: Come in, Anita!Am I glad to see you.  
> We have big problems.  
> The monthly sales figures came in yesterday.  
> I stayed up all night worrying about our company's future.  
> ANITA: Mike, how awful!  
> Have you talked to Jeff yet?  
MIKE: No. I tried to reach him, but he's out of town.  
ANITA: Hmm, that's too bad.  
He's always been helpful in a crisis.  
But anyway, tell me what's happened.  
Why are you so worried?  
MIKE: Oh, I'm really overwhelmed.  
I don't know where to start.  
Last month, two of our biggest retailers reduced their standing orders by 15%.  
We've maintained some growth since then, but I don't see how it can last.  
ANITA: That doesn't sound good.  
Why are sales down?  
I thought we had the best product on the market.  
MIKE: Well, we do, but our competition has started to catch up with us.  
We're not growing the way we need to.  
ANITA: Have there been problems in the marketing department?  
Aren't the product managers doing their jobs?  
MIKE: Marketing says it's not their fault.  
They say they haven't had much flexibility lately in terms of dealer incentives and sales programs.  
Also, our product line is limited because we only have courses for a handful of languages.  
ANITA: When Mom and Dad left us this company, I thought we'd be set for life.  
MIKE: Yeah, me too. Running a company just hasn't turned out to be so easy.  
ANITA: I know what you mean.  
Well, maybe we should bring in a consultant to review our strategy.  
We have to do something before it's too late.  
MIKE: You're right. We have to focus on finding a solution.  
Maybe then I'll sleep better.  
解说员：Mike Davis 和他的姐姐 Anita 正在讨论公司。Accelerated English 发生了什么？  
MIKE Anita，请进！  
很高兴见到您。  
我们出大麻烦了。  
月销售额昨天统计出来了。  
我很担心我们公司的前途，昨晚一夜都没睡。  
ANITA Mike，这样不好！  
您跟 Jeff 说过了吗？  
MIKE 还没有。我找过他，可他出差去了。  
ANITA 真是太糟糕了。  
他对处理危机总是很有办法。  
先不管别的，告诉我究竟怎么了？  
你为什么要那么担心？  
MIKE 我真有点儿不知所措了。  
怎么说呢？  
上个月，我们两家最大的零售商将他们的常规订单减少了15％。  
虽然在那以后我们仍保持一些增长，但我看不出它能持续多久。  
ANITA 看来很不妙。  
销售为什么会下降呢？  
我还以为我们拥有市场上最好的产品呢。  
MIKE 那倒不错，但是我们的竞争对手已经开始在赶上我们。  
我们的发展没有跟上市场的要求。  
ANITA 销售部有没有出问题？  
是不是销售经理没有做好他们的工作？  
MIKE 销售部说这不是他们的错。  
他们说他们近来在经销奖励与销售方案方面已经没有多少弹性了。  
此外，我们的产品系列有限，是因为我们只有适用于少数语言的课程。  
ANITA 当初爸爸妈妈把这个公司留给我们时，我还以为这辈子不用愁了。  
MIKE 可不是，我也这么想来着。经营一个公司并不象原来想的那么容易。  
ANITA 我也深有同感。  
看来，我们也许应该请个顾问来审查一下我们的策略。  
我们应该及早采取措施。  
MIKE 没错。我们要重点找出解决方法。  
那样也许能让我睡好一点儿。

> NARRATOR: The rate of sales growth at Accelerated English has declined, and the company is in trouble. Mike Davis is talking to Carmen Gomez, a consultant, about the company's problems.  
MIKE: Good morning. I'm Mike Davis.  Thank you for meeting with me.  
CARMEN: Carmen Gomez. Nice to meet you.  
How can I help?  
MIKE: I understand that Global Solutions specializes in business strategy.  
We've been experiencing a decline in sales growth recently, and we need to explore new options.  
At this point, I want to ensure the company's long-term stability and solidify our market position.  
CARMEN: Well, we certainly have a lot of experience in that area.  
Why don't you tell me a little more about Accelerated English?  
MIKE: Sure. Well, as you know from the information we sent you yesterday, we develop online language learning courses.  
My sister, our cousin, and I inherited the family business about five years ago.  
We've been leading the domestic market in this category, but I'm very concerned that our competition is catching up.  
CARMEN: That's understandable.  
So, tell me about your main competitor…and your primary target market.  
MIKE: Well, our biggest competition comes from Speakware, a large company that's been gaining market share in the language segment.  
Our target market is adult consumers here in the U.S., mostly through mid-sized retailers.  
I'm worried that we need to broaden our customer base if we're going to survive.  
CARMEN: Yes, that's important.  
And do you have any other major concerns?  
MIKE: Yes, another problem is that our development costs have been increasing.  
We're having trouble launching new products quickly enough.  
CARMEN: I see. So, tell me about your products.  
MIKE: Oh, we have the best products in the industry!  
But I'm afraid we've been having problems marketing our new courses.  
Our company's name isn't very well known beyond our primary market.  
CARMEN: Name recognition is an important factor to consider.  
But since your sales growth hasn't declined too much yet, we have time to make improvements.  
MIKE: I'm happy to hear you say that.  
My sister and I are looking forward to your recommendations.  
What should we do next?  
CARMEN: Well, first I'll review the information you sent me  
and do some general research on your industry.  
Then, I'll get back to you with a couple of options.  
解说员：Accelerated English 的销售增速下滑，公司遭遇困境。Mike Davis 正在与顾问 Carmen Gomez 讨论公司的问题。  
MIKE: 早上好。 我是 Mike Davis。  
感谢您能会见我。  
CARMEN: Carmen Gomez。很高兴见到您。  
我该如何帮助您？  
MIKE: 我知道 Global Solutions 专门从事商业策略。  
我们公司的销售增长率最近正在下降，我们需要开拓新的项目。  
此时，我想确保公司的长期稳定性，并想巩固我们的市场地位。  
CARMEN: 我们在那个领域的确有相当多的经验。  
您再多介绍一些关于 Accelerated English 的情况吧。  
MIKE: 当然。 嗯，从我们昨天发给你的信息中可以了解到，我们逐步编写在线语言学习课程。  
我的姐姐，堂兄和我大约在五年前继承了这份家族产业。  
我们在国内市场的这一业中一直处于领先地位，但我担心我们的竞争对手正在赶上来。  
CARMEN: 那是可以理解的。  
请告诉我您的主要竞争对手...以及您的主要目标市场。  
MIKE: 我们的最大竞争对手是 Speakware，这是一个很大的软件公司，它在语言项目方面的市场份额在上升。  
我们的目标市场是当地美国的成人消费者，主要销售渠道是中型零售商店。  
我担心如果我们要生存下去，就必须拓宽顾客面。  
CARMEN: 是的，这一点非常重要。  
还有其它的忧虑吗？  
MIKE: 另一个问题就是开发成本越来越大。  
我们在迅速推出新产品方面遇到了麻烦。  
CARMEN: 我明白了。 所以请介绍一下你们的产品。  
MIKE: 在这个行业我们拥有最好的产品！  
但恐怕我们的新课程销售问题不断。  
我们公司的名字在我们主要市场之外的领域还不是非常有名。  
CARMEN: 知名度是需要考虑的一个重要因素。  
因为您的销售增长率下降的还不是非常厉害，我们仍有时间做一些改进工作。  
MIKE: 很高兴听到您这么说。  
我姐姐和我都期望着您的建议。  
我们下一步怎么做？  
CARMEN: 好的，首先我要先查看一下您发给我的资料。  
并且在这个行业做一些综合调查。  
然后，我再回来找您，提出我的两个建议。

customer base
, it is easy for the sales team to conduct business in every part of the world.

catch up

7. Accelerated English wants its software to be so familiar to people that 
name recognition

### 3.1 listening  
> NARRATOR: Carmen Gomez is presenting two strategic options to Mike Davis.  
CARMEN: Now that I understand more about Accelerated English and its market, I have two suggestions to present to you.  
I think they both have merit, so you'll need to decide which one is best for you and the company.  
MIKE: That's great. I'm eager to hear your ideas.  
CARMEN: Well, your first option is to improve your strategy and focus on internal growth.  
You might consider improving customer service,  
entering the corporate market, or launching a new advertising campaign.  
If you go in this direction, you'll need to take out a loan.  
MIKE: And that means we'll have to find a source of funding.  
CARMEN: Yes, but once you have the money, you'll be free to implement your new strategy, with almost no strings attached.  
MIKE: That sounds like a good idea.  
So, what's my other option?  
CARMEN: The other alternative is to sell Accelerated to a company that already has global reach.  
A large partner could allow you to expand into Europe and Asia immediately.  
That boost to your sales may be just what Accelerated needs.  
MIKE: Well, developing overseas markets is certainly one of our long-term goals.  
But if I sell, won't I lose control of the company?  
CARMEN: No, not necessarily.  
With the right buyer, you could negotiate to keep your position.  
MIKE: Huh. I didn't even consider that option.  
And are there other benefits of selling?  
CARMEN: Well, if you sell to a financially sound company, your money problems should disappear.  
That way, you can focus on product development and marketing instead of production costs.  
MIKE: I see your point, but I don't like the idea of strangers running the business.  
I really want to keep our company in the family.  
CARMEN: I understand your concerns.  
But if you can find a company that's a good fit, you might get everything you want.  
You might also make a very nice profit.  
My analysis shows that the company could be worth 750 million dollars to the right buyer.  
MIKE: Well, let me think about it.  
I also need to meet with my sister and our cousin to find out what they want to do.  
CARMEN: That's fine. I know this must be a hard decision.  
Take some time to consider the two options, and we can meet again later in the week.  
I should be available on Friday.  
解说员：Carmen Gomez 正在向 Mike Davis 介绍两个战略选择。  
CARMEN: 现在我对 Accelerated English 和它的市场情况有了更深的了解，这是我的两个建议。  
我认为他们都有优点，所以您必须决定哪个更适合您以及您的公司。  
MIKE: 非常好。我很想听听您的观点。  
CARMEN: 好，第一个建议是改善经营策略，把精力集中在内部发展上。  
您可能应该考虑改善客户服务，  
进入共同市场，或推出新的广告活动。  
如果这样做，就必须贷款。  
MIKE: 那就意味着我们必须找到资金来源。  
CARMEN: 是的，但是一旦您拥有了这笔资金，就可以自由地执行您的新策略，而几乎不受任何约束。  
MIKE: 听起来是个好建议。  
我的另一个选择是什么呢？  
CARMEN: 另一个办法是将 Accelerated 卖给一个全球化的公司。  
这个大的合作伙伴将使您立即地发展到欧洲和亚洲市场。  
销售额会大增这大概正是 Accelerated 所需要的。  
MIKE: 发展海外市场当然是我们的长期目标之一。  
但是如果卖掉公司，不就失去了对公司的控制权吗？  
CARMEN: 不，不一定。  
有了合适的买家，就可以通过谈判来保持您的位置。  
MIKE: 我还没考虑这个建议。  
出售公司还有其它好处吗？  
CARMEN: 是这样，如果您出售给一家财务健全的公司，资金问题就解决了。  
那样，您就可以集中精力于开发和销售产品，而不用顾及产品的成本。  
MIKE: 我明白您的建议，但我不想让陌生人来经营此业务。  
我很想由本家族来管理这个公司。  
CARMEN: 我明白您的忧虑。  
但如果能找到一家非常合适的公司，您就可能得到想要的一切。  
并且有可能获得非常好的收益。  
据我分析公司如果卖给合适的买主，它可能值五千万美元。  
MIKE: 那好，让我仔细想想。  
我还必须与我的姐姐和堂兄谈一谈，看看他们的想法？  
CARMEN: 那好。我知道这是一个艰难的选择。  
请花些时间考虑一下这两个建议，本周我们另约时间再谈。  
星期五我有空。

source of funding
.
3. We can 
boost
 domestic sales by broadening our product line and increasing our name recognition.

no strings attached

implemented
 just last month, and already there have been fewer accidents.
6. My financial advisor suggested that I consider an alternative investment 
option

7. Your suggestion has 
merit
 and it might work, but I want to examine some other options before I make a final decision.  
### 4.1 listening  
 > NARRATOR: Mike Davis tells Carmen Gomez that he doesn't want to sell Accelerated English. How does Carmen respond?  
MIKE: I must thank you for coming by on such short notice.  
I didn't want to wait any longer than absolutely necessary.  
CARMEN: Oh, you don't need to thank me.  
I have to be available to my clients.  
So tell me what's on your mind.  
MIKE: Well, I've thought about the two business strategy options we discussed the other day.  
I prefer raising new capital  
and re-focusing the business instead of selling the company.  
CARMEN: That's certainly a viable option.  
Have you had a chance to speak with your sister and cousin yet?  
You'll have to reach a consensus before you present your ideas to the Board of Directors.  
MIKE: Yes, we all need to agree.  
My cousin has been out of town, but my sister and I plan to meet with him tomorrow.  
In any case, I strongly believe that remaining independent is a better alternative in the long run.  
CARMEN: Perhaps, but you realize there are many risks involved in restructuring the company and entering new markets.  
For instance, you'll need to change the company's focus while still maintaining your core businesses.  
You might run the risk of losing some of your good customers.  
Also, taking in significant new money means you'll have to be accountable to the bank.  
MIKE: Yes, I know, but Accelerated's got to survive as an independent company, not as a subsidiary of a larger company.  
I've done a lot to build the business since my parents first started it,  
and the employees are counting on me to maintain a good workplace and culture.  
I can't disappoint them.  
There could be layoffs and consolidation with a new owner.  
CARMEN: Well, I certainly understand why you feel that way.  
You don't have to convince me that this is the best option, but you do need to convince the others.  
MIKE: Oh, I'll convince them, all right.  
I have no choice.  
This is much too important.  
解说员：Mike Davis 告诉 Carmen Gomez 他不想出售 Accelerated English。Carmen 如何回应？  
MIKE: 对您能如此迅速地赶来，我必须表示感谢。  
除非绝对必要，否则我不想等。  
CARMEN: 您不必感谢我。  
我得随时和客户见面。  
请告诉我您的想法。  
MIKE: 好的，我已经考虑了那天我们讨论过的两个有关商业策略的建议。  
我倾向于筹集新资金。  
并且重新调整业务重心，而不是要卖掉公司。  
CARMEN: 那的确是个可行的建议。  
您同您的姐姐和堂兄谈过了吗？  
在将观点提交董事会之前，你们必须得达成一致意见。  
MIKE: 是的，我们都必须同意。  
我的堂兄出城去了，但我和我姐姐打算明天和他会面。  
无论如何，我都坚决认为，从长远来看，保持公司独立是一个较好的选择。  
CARMEN: 但是您也许意识到在重组公司并进入新市场的过程中会遭遇许多风险。  
例如，您在维持公司的核心经营的同时，还将必须改变公司的重点。  
您也许会为此冒风险，而失去一些非常好的客户。  
同时，贷款一大笔资金就意味着您将必须对银行负责。  
MIKE: 是的，我知道，但是 Accelerated 必须作为一个独立的公司生存下去，而不是某个大公司的子公司。  
自从我的父母开创这家公司以来，我为建设公司付出了很大的精力。  
并且雇员们还指望我维持一个良好的工作场所和企业文化。  
我不能让他们失望。  
新业主可能会裁员和重组公司。  
CARMEN: 我非常理解您的想法。  
您不必说服我相信这是最佳的选择，但您需要说服其他人。  
MIKE: 噢，我会去说服他们的。  
我别无选择。  
这一点非常重要。

### 5.1 listening  
> NARRATOR: Mike is talking to Anita about his meeting with Carmen.  
ANITA: Hi, Mike. So, tell me about your meeting with Carmen.  
MIKE: Oh, it was very productive.  
She said we have a great company.  
All we need is the right strategy to make it grow. And a loan.  
ANITA: I see. So how exactly are we going to accomplish this growth?  
MIKE: Well, first, she said we should focus on improving customer service.  
That's the most important thing.  
Plus, we ought to test some new corporate markets and develop a catchy ad campaign.  
I think she's right on target.  
ANITA: Well, I'm afraid I don't agree with you, Mike.  
We just don't have the resources to make these kinds of changes.  
Didn't she make any other suggestions?  
MIKE: She did. She said we could sell the company.  
But, of course, I told her we weren't interested in that.  
ANITA: What? Why did you tell her that?  
We'll make a lot of money if we sell.  
You'd better reconsider, Mike.  
It might be better to take a profit while we can.  
MIKE: Anita, this is our family business!  
You can't be serious about selling.  
What about tradition?  
And what about the employees?  
We have an obligation to them... and to ourselves.  
ANITA: I see your point, but I'm sure we can find a buyer who'd agree to keep the employees.  
That's not the issue.  
Our problem is that we're in a cutthroat industry, and we don't have the right kind of management experience.  
MIKE: Oh, I completely disagree.  
And I'm insulted. We have a great team.  
This company is already worth 750 million, and could be worth a lot more in the future.  
Why should we sell such a gold mine?  
ANITA: 750 million? Are you kidding?! That's ridiculous.  
We're probably worth only half that.  
I think you're being too optimistic about our potential earnings growth.  
MIKE: I'm sorry, but I just don't agree.  
We can continue to expand significantly on our own.  
All we need is some more advice from Carmen and a small bank loan.  
I'm the CEO, and I say we can do it!  
ANITA: Oh, Mike, don't be so stubborn.  
I own this company, too, and I say we ought to sell.  
MIKE: Well, we'll see what Jeff has to say about that!    
解说员：Mike 正在与 Anita 讨论他与 Carmen 的会议。  
ANITA: 嗨，Mike。那么，讲讲你和 Carmen 会谈的情况。  
MIKE: 收获颇多。  
她说我们有个很不错的公司。  
我们所需要的只是发展公司的正确策略和贷款。  
ANITA: 那么我们到底该如何实现增长呢？  
MIKE: 好，首先，她说我们应该致力于改善顾客服务。  
这是最重要的。  
此外，我们应该尝试新的企业用户市场，并且展开引人注目的广告活动。  
我认为她一语中的。  
ANITA: 我恐怕不能同意你的看法，Mike。  
我们没有资源进行这类改革。  
她没有其它的建议吗？  
MIKE: 有。她说我们可以把公司卖掉。  
但是，我告诉她我们对此不感兴趣。  
ANITA: 什么？你为什么这样说？  
如果将公司卖掉，我们会有很赚多钱。  
你最好重新考虑一下，Mike。  
最好是在我们能获利的时候就获利。  
MIKE: Anita，这是我们家族的产业！  
你不能真把公司卖掉。  
家族传统怎么办。  
雇员怎么办？  
我们应该对他们负责...也对我们自己负责。  
ANITA: 我明白你的意思，但是我能保证找到一位愿意保留雇员的买主。  
问题不在这儿。  
我们的问题在于我们面临着激烈的行业竞争，而我们却没有合适的管理经验。  
MIKE: 噢，我完全不同意。  
这对我是个侮辱。我们有一个优秀的班子。  
这家公司现在价值 7.5 亿，而且将来可能会值钱得多。  
我们为什么要把这样一个金矿卖掉？  
ANITA: 7.5 亿？ 开玩笑吗你？！ 这太离谱了。  
我们大概只值那个钱数的一半。  
我认为你对我们的潜在收入的增长过于乐观。  
MIKE: 抱歉，我完全不同意。  
我们可以靠自己继续卓有成效地扩展公司业务。  
我们只需要 Carmen 提供更多的建议和一小笔贷款。  
我是总裁(CEO)，我说了我们能做到！  
ANITA: 噢，Mike，不要这么固执。  
我也拥有这家公司，我认为我们应该卖掉它。  
MIKE: 好，我们来看看 Jeff 的意见。
