# Global English  
## Level 7  
### 1.1 listening  
> NARRATOR: Mike Davis and his sister Anita are talking about their company. What's going on at Accelerated English?  
> MIKE: Come in, Anita!Am I glad to see you.  
> We have big problems.  
> The monthly sales figures came in yesterday.  
> I stayed up all night worrying about our company's future.  
> ANITA: Mike, how awful!  
> Have you talked to Jeff yet?  
MIKE: No. I tried to reach him, but he's out of town.  
ANITA: Hmm, that's too bad.  
He's always been helpful in a crisis.  
But anyway, tell me what's happened.  
Why are you so worried?  
MIKE: Oh, I'm really overwhelmed.  
I don't know where to start.  
Last month, two of our biggest retailers reduced their standing orders by 15%.  
We've maintained some growth since then, but I don't see how it can last.  
ANITA: That doesn't sound good.  
Why are sales down?  
I thought we had the best product on the market.  
MIKE: Well, we do, but our competition has started to catch up with us.  
We're not growing the way we need to.  
ANITA: Have there been problems in the marketing department?  
Aren't the product managers doing their jobs?  
MIKE: Marketing says it's not their fault.  
They say they haven't had much flexibility lately in terms of dealer incentives and sales programs.  
Also, our product line is limited because we only have courses for a handful of languages.  
ANITA: When Mom and Dad left us this company, I thought we'd be set for life.  
MIKE: Yeah, me too. Running a company just hasn't turned out to be so easy.  
ANITA: I know what you mean.  
Well, maybe we should bring in a consultant to review our strategy.  
We have to do something before it's too late.  
MIKE: You're right. We have to focus on finding a solution.  
Maybe then I'll sleep better.  
解说员：Mike Davis 和他的姐姐 Anita 正在讨论公司。Accelerated English 发生了什么？  
MIKE Anita，请进！  
很高兴见到您。  
我们出大麻烦了。  
月销售额昨天统计出来了。  
我很担心我们公司的前途，昨晚一夜都没睡。  
ANITA Mike，这样不好！  
您跟 Jeff 说过了吗？  
MIKE 还没有。我找过他，可他出差去了。  
ANITA 真是太糟糕了。  
他对处理危机总是很有办法。  
先不管别的，告诉我究竟怎么了？  
你为什么要那么担心？  
MIKE 我真有点儿不知所措了。  
怎么说呢？  
上个月，我们两家最大的零售商将他们的常规订单减少了15％。  
虽然在那以后我们仍保持一些增长，但我看不出它能持续多久。  
ANITA 看来很不妙。  
销售为什么会下降呢？  
我还以为我们拥有市场上最好的产品呢。  
MIKE 那倒不错，但是我们的竞争对手已经开始在赶上我们。  
我们的发展没有跟上市场的要求。  
ANITA 销售部有没有出问题？  
是不是销售经理没有做好他们的工作？  
MIKE 销售部说这不是他们的错。  
他们说他们近来在经销奖励与销售方案方面已经没有多少弹性了。  
此外，我们的产品系列有限，是因为我们只有适用于少数语言的课程。  
ANITA 当初爸爸妈妈把这个公司留给我们时，我还以为这辈子不用愁了。  
MIKE 可不是，我也这么想来着。经营一个公司并不象原来想的那么容易。  
ANITA 我也深有同感。  
看来，我们也许应该请个顾问来审查一下我们的策略。  
我们应该及早采取措施。  
MIKE 没错。我们要重点找出解决方法。  
那样也许能让我睡好一点儿。

### 2.1 listening  
NARRATOR: The rate of sales growth at Accelerated English has declined, and the company is in trouble. Mike Davis is talking to Carmen Gomez, a consultant, about the company's problems.  
MIKE: Good morning. I'm Mike Davis.  Thank you for meeting with me.  
CARMEN: Carmen Gomez. Nice to meet you.  
How can I help?  
MIKE: I understand that Global Solutions specializes in business strategy.  
We've been experiencing a decline in sales growth recently, and we need to explore new options.  
At this point, I want to ensure the company's long-term stability and solidify our market position.  
CARMEN: Well, we certainly have a lot of experience in that area.  
Why don't you tell me a little more about Accelerated English?  
MIKE: Sure. Well, as you know from the information we sent you yesterday, we develop online language learning courses.  
My sister, our cousin, and I inherited the family business about five years ago.  
We've been leading the domestic market in this category, but I'm very concerned that our competition is catching up.  
CARMEN: That's understandable.  
So, tell me about your main competitor…and your primary target market.  
MIKE: Well, our biggest competition comes from Speakware, a large company that's been gaining market share in the language segment.  
Our target market is adult consumers here in the U.S., mostly through mid-sized retailers.  
I'm worried that we need to broaden our customer base if we're going to survive.  
CARMEN: Yes, that's important.  
And do you have any other major concerns?  
MIKE: Yes, another problem is that our development costs have been increasing.  
We're having trouble launching new products quickly enough.  
CARMEN: I see. So, tell me about your products.  
MIKE: Oh, we have the best products in the industry!  
But I'm afraid we've been having problems marketing our new courses.  
Our company's name isn't very well known beyond our primary market.  
CARMEN: Name recognition is an important factor to consider.  
But since your sales growth hasn't declined too much yet, we have time to make improvements.  
MIKE: I'm happy to hear you say that.  
My sister and I are looking forward to your recommendations.  
What should we do next?  
CARMEN: Well, first I'll review the information you sent me  
and do some general research on your industry.  
Then, I'll get back to you with a couple of options.  
解说员：Accelerated English 的销售增速下滑，公司遭遇困境。Mike Davis 正在与顾问 Carmen Gomez 讨论公司的问题。  
MIKE: 早上好。 我是 Mike Davis。  
感谢您能会见我。  
CARMEN: Carmen Gomez。很高兴见到您。  
我该如何帮助您？  
MIKE: 我知道 Global Solutions 专门从事商业策略。  
我们公司的销售增长率最近正在下降，我们需要开拓新的项目。  
此时，我想确保公司的长期稳定性，并想巩固我们的市场地位。  
CARMEN: 我们在那个领域的确有相当多的经验。  
您再多介绍一些关于 Accelerated English 的情况吧。  
MIKE: 当然。 嗯，从我们昨天发给你的信息中可以了解到，我们逐步编写在线语言学习课程。  
我的姐姐，堂兄和我大约在五年前继承了这份家族产业。  
我们在国内市场的这一业中一直处于领先地位，但我担心我们的竞争对手正在赶上来。  
CARMEN: 那是可以理解的。  
请告诉我您的主要竞争对手...以及您的主要目标市场。  
MIKE: 我们的最大竞争对手是 Speakware，这是一个很大的软件公司，它在语言项目方面的市场份额在上升。  
我们的目标市场是当地美国的成人消费者，主要销售渠道是中型零售商店。  
我担心如果我们要生存下去，就必须拓宽顾客面。  
CARMEN: 是的，这一点非常重要。  
还有其它的忧虑吗？  
MIKE: 另一个问题就是开发成本越来越大。  
我们在迅速推出新产品方面遇到了麻烦。  
CARMEN: 我明白了。 所以请介绍一下你们的产品。  
MIKE: 在这个行业我们拥有最好的产品！  
但恐怕我们的新课程销售问题不断。  
我们公司的名字在我们主要市场之外的领域还不是非常有名。  
CARMEN: 知名度是需要考虑的一个重要因素。  
因为您的销售增长率下降的还不是非常厉害，我们仍有时间做一些改进工作。  
MIKE: 很高兴听到您这么说。  
我姐姐和我都期望着您的建议。  
我们下一步怎么做？  
CARMEN: 好的，首先我要先查看一下您发给我的资料。  
并且在这个行业做一些综合调查。  
然后，我再回来找您，提出我的两个建议。
