> NARRATOR: Mike Davis and his sister Anita are talking about their company. What's going on at Accelerated English?  
> MIKE: Come in, Anita!Am I glad to see you.  
> We have big problems.  
> The monthly sales figures came in yesterday.  
> I stayed up all night worrying about our company's future.  
> ANITA: Mike, how awful!  
> Have you talked to Jeff yet?  
MIKE: No. I tried to reach him, but he's out of town.  
ANITA: Hmm, that's too bad.  
He's always been helpful in a crisis.  
But anyway, tell me what's happened.  
Why are you so worried?  
MIKE: Oh, I'm really overwhelmed.  
I don't know where to start.  
Last month, two of our biggest retailers reduced their standing orders by 15%.  
We've maintained some growth since then, but I don't see how it can last.  
ANITA: That doesn't sound good.  
Why are sales down?  
I thought we had the best product on the market.  
MIKE: Well, we do, but our competition has started to catch up with us.  
We're not growing the way we need to.  
ANITA: Have there been problems in the marketing department?  
Aren't the product managers doing their jobs?  
MIKE: Marketing says it's not their fault.  
They say they haven't had much flexibility lately in terms of dealer incentives and sales programs.  
Also, our product line is limited because we only have courses for a handful of languages.  
ANITA: When Mom and Dad left us this company, I thought we'd be set for life.  
MIKE: Yeah, me too. Running a company just hasn't turned out to be so easy.  
ANITA: I know what you mean.  
Well, maybe we should bring in a consultant to review our strategy.  
We have to do something before it's too late.  
MIKE: You're right. We have to focus on finding a solution.  
Maybe then I'll sleep better.  
解说员：Mike Davis 和他的姐姐 Anita 正在讨论公司。Accelerated English 发生了什么？  
MIKE Anita，请进！  
很高兴见到您。  
我们出大麻烦了。  
月销售额昨天统计出来了。  
我很担心我们公司的前途，昨晚一夜都没睡。  
ANITA Mike，这样不好！  
您跟 Jeff 说过了吗？  
MIKE 还没有。我找过他，可他出差去了。  
ANITA 真是太糟糕了。  
他对处理危机总是很有办法。  
先不管别的，告诉我究竟怎么了？  
你为什么要那么担心？  
MIKE 我真有点儿不知所措了。  
怎么说呢？  
上个月，我们两家最大的零售商将他们的常规订单减少了15％。  
虽然在那以后我们仍保持一些增长，但我看不出它能持续多久。  
ANITA 看来很不妙。  
销售为什么会下降呢？  
我还以为我们拥有市场上最好的产品呢。  
MIKE 那倒不错，但是我们的竞争对手已经开始在赶上我们。  
我们的发展没有跟上市场的要求。  
ANITA 销售部有没有出问题？  
是不是销售经理没有做好他们的工作？  
MIKE 销售部说这不是他们的错。  
他们说他们近来在经销奖励与销售方案方面已经没有多少弹性了。  
此外，我们的产品系列有限，是因为我们只有适用于少数语言的课程。  
ANITA 当初爸爸妈妈把这个公司留给我们时，我还以为这辈子不用愁了。  
MIKE 可不是，我也这么想来着。经营一个公司并不象原来想的那么容易。  
ANITA 我也深有同感。  
看来，我们也许应该请个顾问来审查一下我们的策略。  
我们应该及早采取措施。  
MIKE 没错。我们要重点找出解决方法。  
那样也许能让我睡好一点儿。
