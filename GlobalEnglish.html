            NARRATOR: Belle Vie, a perfume company based in Paris, has been having financial problems recently.<br />

            Sales of its flagship product, L'Amour, have been dropping.<br />

            NARRATOR: The company has hired Global Solutions, a consulting firm based in Brussels, Belgium, to help make some changes.<br />

            The consultants who are working on the case are Kenji Watanabe and Rupert Andrews.<br />

            NARRATOR: Bernard Valence, the CEO, is planning to launch a new men's fragrance even though Belle Vie has always made women's products.<br />

            NARRATOR: Isabelle Rollette, the CFO, believes that developing a new line for a very different consumer would be risky.<br />

            She thinks it would be safer to expand and diversify the women's fragrance and accessories lines.<br />

            NARRATOR: Simone Buttet, Vice President of Research and Development, and Jean-Luc Dubois, Vice President of Marketing, agree with Isabelle.<br />

            They don't understand why Bernard won't support their ideas.<br />

            NARRATOR: What will Kenji and Rupert do to help solve this disagreement?<br />



            Belle Vie，一家在巴黎的香水公司，最近出现了财务问题。<br />

            它的旗舰产品 - L'Amour 的销售量正在下滑。<br />

            这家公司已经雇请 Global Solutions，一家在比利时布鲁塞尔的咨询公司，来帮助进行一些改革。<br />

            正在从事这项工作的顾问是 Kenji Watanabe 和 Rupert Andrews。<br />

            尽管 Belle Vie 一直生产女用香水，总裁 (CEO) Bernard Valence 在计划推出一种新的男用香水。<br />

            财务长(CFO) Isabelle Rollette 认为为一群完全不同的消费者开发一种新的产品种类将会冒风险。<br />

            她认为扩展和使女用香水品种和装饰品种类多样化会比较保险。<br />

            研发部副总裁 Simone Buttet，与营销部副总裁 Jean-Luc Dubois 赞同 Isabelle 的意见。<br />

            他们不明白 Bernard 为什么不支持他们的想法。<br />

            为解决这种分歧，Kenji 和 Rupert 将会做些什么？<br />
        </p>
        <h3 id="6-1-2">1.2listening </h3>
        <p>
            NARRATOR: Kenji and Rupert are discussing the information they've gathered at Belle Vie.<br />

            What will they do next?<br />

            KENJI: So, now that we've talked with Belle Vie's management team, let's go over the information we've gathered.<br />

            What did you learn from speaking with Isabelle Rollette?<br />

            RUPERT: Well, Isabelle's very sharp.<br />

            She has several ideas for new initiatives, but I think she's frustrated that Bernard has given her very little support.<br />

            KENJI: I see.<br />

            Why do you think Bernard is resisting?<br />

            Is it because Belle Vie might not be able to raise enough money to implement so many ideas?<br />

            RUPERT: Well, I don't know why he's resisting, but I don't think that it's because of cost.<br />

            Isabelle recently met with a Canadian bank about a loan.<br />

            At this point, she doesn't think financing will be a problem.<br />

            Did you get to spend much time with the VPs?<br />

            KENJI: Yes, I did.<br />

            I received a lot of input from Buttet, who heads R&D, and Dubois, who's in charge of marketing.<br />

            I think that Belle Vie's senior management has a real vision for how the company might improve sales by reaching out to the growing young adult market.<br />

            But they also said that Bernard just hasn't given them much support.<br />

            RUPERT: Really? In what way?<br />

            Did they give you any specifics?<br />

            KENJI: Well, both Buttet and Dubois want to rely less on L'Amour.<br />

            They want to develop new products for younger women.<br />

            Belle Vie already understands the female market.<br />

            BUT SO FAR, BERNARD WANTS TO EXPAND ONLY INTO AN ENTIRELY NEW MARKET: men's fragrances.<br />

            RUPERT: Even though our research shows that Belle Vie is strong enough to expand into both markets?<br />

            KENJI: Yes. At this stage, I think we should do more research.<br />

            We need to persuade Bernard to consider several ideas.<br />

            RUPERT: Yes. I agree.<br />

            So, to conclude, we should get his approval to expand the scope of our work.<br />

            Let's explore how Belle Vie might develop new product lines and position them for both markets.<br />



            NARRATOR: Kenji 和 Rupert 正在讨论他们收集到和 Belle Vie 有关的资料。<br />

            接下来他们会怎么做？<br />

            KENJI: 因此，既然我们谈到了 Belle Vie 的管理班子，让我们浏览一下收集到的信息。<br />

            在与 Isabelle Rollette 的谈话中您了解到了什么？<br />

            RUPERT: Isabelle 非常精明能干。<br />

            她有意创新，但是我认为她很沮丧，因为 Bernard 几乎不支持她。<br />

            KENJI: 我明白。<br />

            为什么您认为 Bernard 会反对？<br />

            是不是因为 Belle Vie 也许无法筹集足够的资金去实现这么多想法。<br />

            RUPERT: 我不知道他为什么反对，但是我认为这不是成本方面的原因。<br />

            Isabelle 最近就贷款问题与一家加拿大银行进行了接触。<br />

            现在，她认为资金并不会成为问题。<br />

            您花许多时间和副总裁们在一起吗？<br />

            KENJI: 是的，的确这样。<br />

            我收到了来自 Buttet 和 Dubois 的大量信息，前者负责研发部，后者负责营销部。<br />

            我认为 Belle Vie 的高级管理层有远见，对于公司如何通过开拓不断增长的青年人市场，以提高销售量有些实际的想法。<br />

            但是他们也说过 Bernard 并没有大力支持他们。<br />

            RUPERT: 真的吗？ 此话怎讲？<br />

            他们给您说了什么具体情况吗？<br />

            KENJI: 嗯，Buttet 和 Dubois 两个人都想减少对 L'Amour 的依赖。<br />

            他们想开发针对较年轻妇女的新产品。<br />

            Belle Vie 已经对妇女市场很了解。<br />

            但是到目前为止，Bernard 只是想扩展到一个全新的市场-男用香水。<br />

            RUPERT: 不过我们的调查可以证明 Belle Vie 的实力足够开拓两个市场？<br />

            KENJI: 是的。 就目前来看，我认为我们应该再多做一些研究。<br />

            我们要劝说 Bernard 考虑其它几个想法。<br />

            RUPERT: 是的。我同意。<br />
            因此，总的来说，我们应该使他同意我们拓展工作范围。<br />
            让我们研究一下 Belle Vie 该怎样开发新产品品种，和该怎样在两个市场中定位这些产品。<br />

            NARRATOR: Kenji and Rupert have agreed that they must expand the scope of their research.<br />

            Now watch as they meet with Bernard and discuss new directions for Belle Vie.<br />

            What do you think Bernard's reaction will be?<br />

            KENJI: Bernard, thank you for meeting with us this morning.<br />

            We realize that you're quite busy.<br />

            BERNARD: I'm delighted that we could meet. I've read your report.<br />

            Clearly, you've been thorough in researching Belle Vie.<br />

            So I'm eager to hear your ideas for slowing our decline in sales.<br />

            KENJI: Well, we feel that Belle Vie has several options that are worth exploring.<br />

            BERNARD: I see.<br />

            What do you have in mind?<br />

            RUPERT: Well, obviously your management wants to leverage Belle Vie's brand equity.<br />

            Launching a men's fragrance is, of course, one way of doing this.<br />

            But we believe that the time is right to investigate some other directions.<br />

            KENJI: We'd like permission to work with the management team to research new products in the women's fragrance and accessories markets, especially products targeted at younger women.<br />

            BERNARD: Well, you know, I'm hesitant to approve this.<br />

            Not long ago, one of my competitors tried offering women's accessories.<br />

            They lost a lot of money on it for a few years; then they scrapped the entire line.<br />

            RUPERT: Oh, I see. But I'm not sure that your competitor has the strong market identity that Belle Vie has.<br />

            BERNARD: Yes, that's true.<br />

            But I'm still not certain we can reach the under-35 market.<br />

            I assume that's where the new line will be targeted.<br />

            This younger female market is price-sensitive.<br />

            If we lower our prices for them, we may weaken our high-quality image.<br />

            KENJI: Of course, your concerns are reasonable.<br />

            Right now we're just asking for the green light to evaluate a few options and present them to you and the senior management.<br />

            BERNARD: All right, but we'll need more information about our image in the youth market.<br />

            I assume you'll work with our marketing department to do further research.<br />

            KENJI: Yes, we certainly will, and we'll keep you informed about our progress.<br />

            BERNARD: Well then, I think that we should go forward.<br />

            But I won't make a final decision until I hear your recommendations.<br />



            NARRATOR: 在最后一部分作业中，Kenji 和 Rupert 一致认为他们必须扩大调查范围。<br />

            现在观看他们与 Bernard 的会面以及他们关于 Belle Vie 发展新方向的讨论。<br />

            您认为 Bernard 将会有怎样的反应？<br />

            KENJI: Bernard，感谢您能在今天早上会见我们。<br />

            我们知道您特别忙。<br />

            BERNARD: 很高兴我们能见面。 我看过你的报告。<br />

            很明显，您已经对 Belle Vie 做了十分彻底的研究。<br />

            所以我很想听听你对于减缓销量下降的想法。<br />

            KENJI: 嗯，我们认为 Belle Vie 有几种值得探究的选择。<br />

            BERNARD: 我明白。<br />

            您有些什么计画？<br />

            RUPERT: 很明显，您的管理人员想利用 Belle Vie 的品牌价值。<br />

            推出一种男用香水，当然是这个方法确实可行。<br />

            但是我们认为目前的时机适合在其它方向做一些调查。<br />

            KENJI: 我们想获准与管理团队合作，以研究女士香水和饰品市场中的新产品，尤其是面向比较年轻的女士的产品。<br />

            BERNARD: 我不大愿意批准这件事。<br />

            不久以前，我的一个竞争对手力图推出一个新的妇女饰品品种。<br />

            为此，他们在几年中损失了不少钱；于是他们放弃了整个产品线。<br />

            RUPERT: 对于您的竞争对手是否有和 Belle Vie 一样强的市场知名度，我不大清楚。<br />

            BERNARD: 这是真的。<br />

            但是我仍然不敢确定我们是否能够进入顾客年龄为 35 岁以下的市场。<br />

            我猜想这也正是新产品线的目标所在。<br />

            这个较年轻的女性市场对价格很敏感。

            如果我们因为她们而降价，可能会使我们产品的高品质形象受损。<br />

            KENJI: 当然，您的顾虑很有道理。<br />

            目前，我们只是请求允许我们对几项建议进行评估，并且将它们推荐给您和高级管理层。<br />

            BERNARD: 很好，不过我们将需要更多地了解我们产品在年轻人市场中的形象。<br />

            我猜想您将与我们的营销部门协作，以便深入调查。<br />

            KENJI: 是的，我们的确将和他们一起工作，我们将随时将我们的进展告诉您。<br />

            BERNARD: 那么接下来，我想我们应该有所行动。<br />

            聆听您的建议后，我才会做出最终决定。<br />

            NARRATOR: Bernard has agreed to support Kenji and Rupert as they do further research.<br />

            Now, join Jean-Luc Dubois, VP of Marketing, as he meets with Sarah Brown, one of Belle Vie's clients.<br />

            Sarah is a buyer at a department store that sells Belle Vie products.<br />

            She and Jean-Luc are eating dinner at a restaurant in New York.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Sarah, good to see you again.<br />

            It seems like a long time since I was in New York, but really it's only been a few months.<br />

            SARAH: Good to see you too, Jean Luc. I'm glad you could join me for dinner.<br />

            This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: It looks great! I can't wait to try the food. So, tell me.<br />

            How's business been recently?<br />

            SARAH: Oh, not bad.<br />

            Our annual sales were up 3 1/2 percent, which was higher than the industry average.<br />

            I think we're starting to make some of the other New York retailers nervous.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Oh, that's good news. And have you been satisfied with the sales of Belle Vie products?<br />

            SARAH: Oh, yes, of course.<br />

            Our customers continue to be very loyal to Belle Vie.<br />

            WAITER: Good evening.<br />

            Would you like a drink to start?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: I'd like a bottle of sparkling water, please.<br />

            SARAH: I think I'll have a soda.<br />

            A diet cola, please.<br />

            WAITER: Very good.<br />

            I'll be right back to take your order.<br />

            We have some excellent specials tonight.<br />

            The grilled salmon is served with green beans and a baked potato.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: And… how are the beans prepared?<br />

            WAITER: We saute them in sesame oil.<br />

            The other special is pasta in a light cream sauce.<br />

            That comes with a spinach salad.<br />

            I'll be right back with your drinks.<br />

            Please let me know if you have any questions about the menu.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Everything here looks delicious.<br />

            What are you thinking of ordering?<br />

            SARAH: Well I've heard that the seafood here is pretty good, but I can't eat it because I'm allergic to shellfish.<br />

            I'm considering the garlic chicken with rice.<br />

            How about you?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: A salad would be healthier for me, but the roast beef looks too good to pass up.<br />

            WAITER: Here are your drinks.<br />

            Are you ready to order?<br />

            SARAH: Yes, I'd like to start with the garden salad with the house dressing.<br />

            And I'll have the garlic chicken with rice.<br />

            WAITER: Very good.<br />

            And what would you like, sir?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: I'll have the onion soup to start.<br />

            And for my entree, I'd like the roast beef.<br />

            WAITER: And how would you like that cooked?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Could I get it medium rare, please?<br />

            WAITER: Excellent. I'll bring the soup and salad for you right away.<br />

            And save room for dessert. We have a great strawberry pie!<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Well, I'm very glad to hear your customers continue to enjoy Belle Vie products.<br />

            I have some new ideas for this year's line that I'd like to share with you.<br />

            We're thinking about introducing some unusual scents such as chocolate and caramel...<br />

            <br />

            NARRATOR: 在上一个单元中，Bernard 同意支持 Kenji 和 Rupert 做进一步调查。<br />

            现在，请加入营销部副总裁 Jean-Luc Dubois 和 Belle Vie 的客户 Sarah Brown 的会面。<br />

            Sarah 是一家出售 Belle Vie 产品的百货商店的采购员。<br />

            她和 Jean-Luc 正在纽约的一家餐馆吃晚餐。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Sarah，很高兴再次见到您。<br />

            自从我上次来纽约似乎过了很长一段时间，但其实只有几个月。<br />

            SARAH: 我也很高兴见到你，Jean Luc。 很高兴你能与我共进晚餐。<br />

            这是我在纽约最喜欢的餐馆之一。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 看起来好吃极了！ 我等不及尝一口了。 那就点餐吧。<br />

            近来生意怎么样？<br />

            SARAH: 目前状况还不错。<br />

            我们的年销售量增长了 3.5 %，比同行的平均水平要高。<br />

            我认为我们开始让纽约的其它一些零售商变得紧张起来了。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 您对 Belle Vie 产品的销售情况感到满意吗？<br />

            SARAH: 当然。<br />

            我们的客户对 Belle Vie 依旧情有独钟。<br />

            WAITER: 晚上好。<br />

            您想先喝点饮料吗？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 我想要一瓶苏打水。<br />

            SARAH: 我想来瓶苏打水。<br />

            请来杯健怡可乐。<br />

            WAITER: 好的。<br />

            我会马上回来替您点菜。<br />

            今晚我们有一些非常好的特色菜。<br />

            烤鲑鱼带有青豆角和烤马铃薯。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 豆角是怎么做的？<br />

            WAITER: 我们把它放在芝麻油里煎。<br />

            另一份特色菜是拌有淡味奶油调料的意大利面。<br />

            还带有菠菜色拉。<br />

            我马上给您拿饮料来。<br />

            如果您对菜单还有什么疑问，请立刻通知我。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 这里的每样食物看起来都很可口。<br />

            您想点什么菜？<br />

            SARAH: 我听说这里的海产非常不错，但是我不能吃，因为我对贝类过敏。<br />

            我想来份大蒜鸡肉饭。<br />

            您想来点什么？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 色拉对我的身体会更好一些，但是烤牛肉看起来非常好，让我难以错过。<br />

            WAITER: 这是您的饮料。<br />

            您准备点菜吗？<br />

            SARAH: 我想先要一份你们的特制色拉酱拌的菜园色拉。<br />

            我想要一份大蒜鸡肉饭。<br />

            WAITER: 非常好。<br />

            先生，您想吃点什么呢？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 我想先要喝点洋葱汤。<br />

            主菜我想吃烤牛肉。<br />

            WAITER: 牛肉要什么火候的？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 我想要五分熟的，可以吗？<br />

            WAITER: 好。 我马上给您上汤和色拉。<br />

            还要留点儿肚子吃甜点。 我们吃了美味草莓饼！<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 好，我很高兴听到您的顾客依旧喜欢 Belle Vie 的产品。<br />

            我有一些关于今年的产品品线的新想法，想和您谈一谈。<br />

            我们正在考虑引进一些与众不同香型，例如巧克力味和焦糖味...<br />

            NARRATOR: Jean-Luc Dubois is eating dinner with one of his customers, Sarah Brown.<br />

            Sarah is a senior fragrance buyer at a department store in New York.<br />

            Listen as they discuss food customs in different countries.<br />

            SARAH: This is a really interesting menu.<br />

            To be honest, I don't understand half of it!<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Me neither! And I'm always afraid I'll pronounce something wrong when I order.<br />

            SARAH: Yeah, I know what you mean.<br />

            Have I ever told you about the time that I embarrassed myself in a restaurant in Italy?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: No, you haven't.<br />

            What happened?<br />

            SARAH: Well, I was finishing a huge meal at a neighborhood restaurant in Florence.<br />

            I wanted an after dinner coffee, so I ordered a cappuccino.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Which you've done a million times in the States, of course.<br />

            SARAH: Right. Well, in Italy some people consider this bad manners because they typically drink cappuccino only in the morning.<br />

            Espresso is the common drink to have in the evening.<br />

            I think I offended my waiter and the chef, so I've avoided ordering cappuccino after dinner ever since.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Oh, that's terrible.<br />

            I've had some interesting experiences on my business trips, but I've never seen anything like the food I had the New Year's Day I spent in Tokyo.<br />

            SARAH: Really? Why?<br />

            What was it like?<br />

            JEAN-LUC: Well, the Japanese have an interesting custom.<br />

            It's a meal of about a dozen different dishes, and each one represents a wish for the New Year―black beans for health, seaweed for happiness, and so on.<br />

            SARAH: Really? Interesting. And speaking of Asia, I've heard that in some places it's considered impolite to put your chopsticks straight up in a bowl of rice.<br />

            It reminds people of death.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: That's true.<br />

            And someone once told me that in Thailand, it's very rude to put your feet at a higher level than rice or any kind of food.<br />

            The feet are considered to be the lowest, most unclean part of the body.<br />

            SARAH: Really? I didn't know that.<br />

            Well, next time you're in New York, you'll have to fill me in on any new food customs you learn in your travels.<br />

            WAITER: Can I bring you anything else this evening?<br />

            SARAH: No, I don't think we need anything else, thank you.<br />

            JEAN-LUC: May I have the check please?<br />

            You have to allow me to pick up the tab.<br />

            SARAH: Oh no, you don't have to do that…<br />

            JEAN-LUC: No really, I insist.<br />

            You've paid for dinner the last three times I've been in town.<br />

            SARAH: Well, thank you very much, Jean-Luc.<br />

            I look forward to treating you next time.<br />



            NARRATOR: Jean-Luc Dubois 正在和他的一位客户 Sarah Brown 共进晚餐。<br />

            Sarah 是纽约一家百货商店的一位资深香水采购员。<br />

            请听他们对不同国家饮食习惯的讨论。<br />

            SARAH: 这菜单很让人心动。<br />

            说实在的，我连一半都看不懂！<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 我也是！ 点餐时我总怕自己发音不正确。<br />

            SARAH: 我明白你的意思。<br />

            我跟你说过我在意大利餐馆那次尴尬的经历吗？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 没有，我从没听你说过。<br />

            怎么回事？<br />

            SARAH: 我在佛罗伦萨的一家邻里餐馆大吃了一顿。<br />

            我想要晚餐后咖啡，所以我点了一杯卡布奇诺。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 当然，这是你在美国做了不知多少次的事。<br />

            SARAH: 是的。 但是，在意大利有些人认为这是非常不礼貌的，因为他们通常只是在早上喝(卡布其诺)热牛奶咖啡。<br />

            Espresso 是一种平常晚上喝的饮料。<br />

            我想我冒犯了侍者和厨师，因此，从那以后我避免晚饭后喝(卡布其诺)热牛奶咖啡。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 噢，挺可怕的。<br />

            我出差时也有过一些有趣的经历，但是我从没有见过我在东京过新年时吃过的食物。<br />

            SARAH: 真的吗？ 为什么？<br />

            怎么样？<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 日本人有一个有趣的风俗。<br />

            那是一顿有十几道菜的大餐，每道菜代表新年的一个愿望--黑豆代表健康，海藻代表幸福，等等。<br />

            SARAH: 说到亚洲的饮食习惯，我听说，在有些地方将筷子直直地插在一碗米饭上是不礼貌的。<br />

            这样会使人想到死亡。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 是的。<br />

            有人曾经告诉我，在泰国，如果你把脚放得比米饭或任何食品还高，将被认为是十分不礼貌的。<br />

            脚被看作是人身体上最低的，最脏的部分。<br />

            SARAH: 真的吗？ 这我倒没听说过。<br />

            好吧，下次你来纽约得再给我讲讲你出差时了解到的新的饮食风俗。<br />

            WAITER: 今晚你还需要别的什么吗？<br />

            SARAH: 不要了，谢谢。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 请让我付账，好吗？<br />

            这次你得让我来付帐。<br />

            SARAH: 哦不，没那必要。<br />

            JEAN-LUC: 真的，这次我一定要付。<br />

            我来纽约后，最近的三次晚饭都是你结的帐。<br />

            SARAH: 好的，非常感谢，Jean-Luc。<br />

            我希望下次能让我请客。<br />s

            NARRATOR: Jean-Luc Dubois met with Sarah Brown in New York City.<br />

            Sarah confirmed that customers are still loyal to Belle Vie.<br />

            Now Kenji meets with Sophie Leblanc, Belle Vie's advertising manager.<br />

            What will Sophie say about the company's advertising strategy?<br />

            KENJI: My colleague Rupert Andrews and I have already gathered some background information on Belle Vie's products.<br />

            I wanted to meet with you to talk about the company's advertising.<br />

            SOPHIE: I've been looking forward to speaking with you.<br />

            I think the most important issue is that Belle Vie hasn't needed to advertise a lot until now.<br />

            In the early years, L'Amour's success allowed Belle Vie to build a lot of brand equity.<br />

            Since that time, we've remained competitive because of brand loyalty and our strong reputation, not because of our advertising.<br />

            KENJI: I see.<br />

            So you think that now the company should advertise more to attract new customers?<br />

            SOPHIE: Yes, absolutely.<br />

            We've had basically the same ad campaign for the past ten years!<br />

            When some of the newer brands took part of our market share, we didn't react to protect ourselves.<br />

            That's why sales are declining.<br />

            KENJI: Hmm… I see.<br />

            And what other problems are you having?<br />

            SOPHIE: Well, another problem is our media mix.<br />

            We place almost all our ads in women's fashion magazines.<br />

            We've created a sophisticated campaign for L'Amour, but now we need to rethink our strategy to reach a larger―and younger―audience.<br />

            KENJI: And how are you planning to do that?<br />

            SOPHIE: Well, at our management retreat last year, we agreed that Belle Vie has to develop a more aggressive media plan.<br />

            We talked about TV spots and in-store promotions, but we've failed to follow up on these ideas.<br />

            KENJI: I see. I understand that Belle Vie did market research on its positioning.<br />

            What did you learn from the studies?<br />

            SOPHIE: Well, last year's focus groups showed that young women know about Belle Vie.<br />

            They think the company's products are sophisticated and high quality.<br />

            But they aren't really interested in L'Amour.<br />

            KENJI: Huh. You know, I doubt that advertising alone can solve that problem.<br />

            SOPHIE: Yes, I agree with you, but we do need to figure out a way to attract that younger audience.<br />

            If we can create new products for younger women, I'm sure my staff can develop a terrific strategy to reach those women.<br />



            NARRATOR: 在上一次作业中，Jean-Luc Dubois 在纽约遇见了 Sarah Brown。<br />

            Sarah 证实顾客仍然钟情于 Belle Vie。<br />

            现在，Kenji 在与 Belle Vie 的广告部经理 Sophie Leblanc 会面。<br />

            关于公司的广告策略，Sophie 将说些什么呢？<br />

            KENJI: 我和我的同事 Rupert Andrews 已经收集了一些有关 Belle Vie 产品的信息。<br />

            我想和你见面，谈谈公司的广告情况。<br />

            SOPHIE: 我一直希望能与你谈谈。<br />

            我认为最重要的问题是 Belle Vie 过去一直不需要做大量的广告，现在则不然。<br />

            早几年，L'Amour 的成功使 Belle Vie 有了较高的品牌价值。<br />

            自那时候起，我们保持着竞争力，靠的是品牌支持度和我们强大的声誉，而不是靠广告。<br />

            KENJI: 我明白。<br />

            那么，你认为现在公司需要靠增加广告来吸引顾客吗？<br />

            SOPHIE: 是的，绝对必要。<br />

            我们的广告活动在过去十年基本上没有变过！<br />

            当一些新的品牌抢占我们的市场份额的时候，我们却不能采取行动保护自己。<br />

            这正是销售额下降的原因。<br />

            KENJI: 嗯... 我明白了。<br />

            你们现在还有其他什么问题？<br />

            SOPHIE: 另外一个问题是我们应该综合运用各种媒体来做广告。<br />

            我们把几乎所有的广告都放在妇女时尚杂志上。<br />

            我们曾为 L'Amour 策划了高档次的广告活动，但是现在我们需要重新考虑面向更庞大、更年轻的消费群体的广告策略。<br />

            KENJI: 你打算怎么做呢？<br />

            SOPHIE: 是这样的，在去年我们管理班子的出外休整时，我们一致认为 Belle Vie 应该发展一个更富挑战性的媒体计划。<br />

            我们谈到过电视广告和零售促销活动，但是我们并没有进一步实施这些想法。<br />

            KENJI: 我知道 Belle Vie 就其市场地位做过调查。<br />

            你从这份调查中了解到了什么？<br />

            SOPHIE: 去年的抽样调查表明年轻妇女对 Belle Vie 有一定的了解。<br />

            她们认为公司的产品档次高，质量好。<br />

            但是她们对 L'Amour 并不真正感兴趣。<br />

            KENJI: 我怀疑单靠广告能否解决这个问题。<br />

            SOPHIE: 我同意你的观点，但是我们必须找到吸引年轻人消费群体的途径。<br />

            如果我们能为比较年轻的女士创造新产品，我的员工一定能为使这些女士了解新产品而逐步制定出绝妙战略。<br />

            NARRATOR: Previously, Kenji Watanabe and Rupert Andrews talked with the management team at Belle Vie about the company's options.<br />

            NARRATOR: Isabelle Rollette, Simone Buttet, and Jean-Luc Dubois agree that Belle Vie should develop a young women's fragrance and diversify its accessories line.<br />

            NARRATOR: Bernard has been interested only in a new men's fragrance line.<br />

            KENJI AND RUPERT WANT TO EXPAND THE SCOPE OF THEIR RESEARCH BECAUSE THEY BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE RESOURCES TO TRY ALL THREE OPTIONS: a young women's fragrance, a men's fragrance, and a new accessories line.<br />

            NARRATOR: Kenji and Rupert have finished their research and are now planning their presentation to Bernard, Isabelle, Simone, and Jean-Luc. What do you think they will suggest to Belle Vie?<br />



            从前，Kenji Watanabe 和 Rupert Andrews 与 Belle Vie 的管理层谈论过 公司的一些选择。<br />

            Isabelle Rollette、Simone Buttet 和 Jean-Luc Dubois 赞成 Belle Vie 应该开发年轻女性用的香水，并扩大它的饰品种类。<br />

            Bernard 一直只对新的男用香水产品感兴趣。<br />

            Kenji 和 Rupert 想扩大他们的考察范围，因为他们认为公司有能力尝试 所有三种可能的选择：年轻女性用的香水、男用香水和新款饰品。<br />

            Kenji 和 Rupert 已完成了他们的考察，现在正准备给 Bernard、Isabelle、 Simone、和 Jean-Luc 作汇报。您觉得他们会对 Belle Vie 提什么样的建议？<br />

        <p>
            NARRATOR: Kenji and Rupert have finished their research and are now planning their presentation to Bernard, Isabelle, Simone, and Jean-Luc.<br />

            What do you think they will suggest to Belle Vie?<br />

            KENJI: Hi, Rupert.<br />

            I'm ready to plan next week's presentation to Belle Vie.<br />

            RUPERT: Great! I am too.<br />

            So, what are your thoughts?<br />

            KENJI: Well, I think we should divide our presentation into three main parts: first, Belle Vie's mature products; second, new fragrances; and third, nonfragrances―that is, cosmetics and accessories.<br />

            RUPERT: Good. That's just what I was thinking.<br />

            KENJI: So let's start with mature products, specifically L'Amour.<br />

            L'Amour's customer base shrinks more every year.<br />

            Belle Vie has to do something, but I don't think they should completely change their advertising approach.<br />

            RUPERT: Me neither.<br />

            Creating a new advertising campaign for L'Amour seems like a low-return option to me.<br />

            A better option is to cut back spending on L'Amour.<br />

            Then the company could redirect L'Amour's profits to other parts of the business.<br />

            KENJI: You have a point, but if Belle Vie reduces spending on L'Amour, sales will continue to drop.<br />

            And then L'Amour won't generate enough profits to use in other parts of the business.<br />

            RUPERT: Yeah… I think you're right.<br />

            Another option is to just change the advertising strategy a little.<br />

            Belle Vie could focus on small changes to help boost sales.<br />

            KENJI: I like this option the best.<br />

            RUPERT: Me too.<br />

            This approach would be low-risk and doesn't have any real downside.<br />

            NOW, LET'S DISCUSS THE TWO NEW FRAGRANCE MARKETS: men and younger women.<br />

            These markets might yield a higher return per investment dollar.<br />

            KENJI: That's true, but it could be very risky to target either of these.<br />

            At this point, I don't think that Belle Vie knows these new markets well enough.<br />

            RUPERT: You're right, but remember that Belle Vie does know the female market.<br />

            Focusing on a new fragrance for young women is probably less risky.<br />

            I think the company should create a young women's fragrance while slowly developing a men's line.<br />

            KENJI: So do I.<br />

            Let's include this strategy in our recommendations.<br />

            At this rate, we'll have plenty of time to write up our presentation.<br />



            NARRATOR: Kenji and Rupert 完成了他们的调查，现在正准备向 Bernard、Isabelle、Simone、和 Jean-Luc 作汇报。<br />

            您认为他们会对 Belle Vie 提出什么样的建议？<br />

            KENJI: Rupert，您好。<br />

            我已经准备了下星期向 Belle Vie 汇报的报告。<br />

            RUPERT: 好极了！ 我也这么想。<br />

            您有什么看法？<br />

            KENJI: 我觉得我们应该把我们的发言分成三大部分：第一，Belle Vie 的老产品；第二，新香水；第三，非香水类产品，也就是化妆品和饰品。<br />

            RUPERT: 不错。跟我想的一样。<br />

            KENJI: 我们先讲老产品，特别是 L'Amour。<br />

            L'Amour 的顾客群每年都在变小，而且每年越来越少。<br />

            Belle Vie 必须采取措施，不过我认为他们不必完全改变他们的广告方法。<br />

            RUPERT: 我也觉得没有必要。<br />

            我觉得为 L'Amour 做新的广告宣传收效不大 。<br />

            较好的办法是削减对 L'Amour 的投资。<br />

            然后，公司可以将 L'Amour 的利润转移到其它业务上去。<br />

            KENJI: 您的话不无道理。可是，如果 Belle Vie 削减对 L'Amour 的投资，它的销售量还会继续下降。<br />

            L'Amour 将不能产生足够的利润供其它业务使用。<br />

            RUPERT: 您说得对。<br />

            那么，另一个办法就是只对广告策略做些小的调整。<br />

            Belle Vie 可以针对可帮助扩大销售量的方面做小的调整。<br />

            KENJI: 我觉得这种办法最好。<br />

            RUPERT: 我也这么想。<br />

            这种做法风险会比较低，而且不会有任何真正的负面结果。<br />

            好，现在我们来谈谈两个新的香水市场：男人和年轻女性。<br />

            这些市场可能会对每分钱的投资产生较高的回报率。<br />

            KENJI: 那倒不错，可是无论开发它们中的哪一个都可能有非常高的风险。<br />

            我觉得 Belle Vie 目前对这些新市场没有足够的了解。<br />

            RUPERT: 您说得对，但别忘了 Belle Vie 对女用香水是很了解的。<br />

            集中开发年轻女性香水的风险可能会比较低。<br />

            我觉得公司应该开发年轻女性的香水，同时再慢慢开发男用香水的品种。<br />

            KENJI: 我也觉得这样比较合适。<br />

            让我们把这个策略包括在我们的建议里去。<br />

            这样的话，我们将有充分的时间来写我们的报告。<br />

            NARRATOR: In the previous scene, consultants Kenji Watanabe and Rupert Andrews prepared their presentation on Belle Vie's options.
            <br />
            Now they will give their presentation to the senior management at Belle Vie.
            <br />
            KENJI: Okay, let's get started.
            <br />
            Good afternoon, and thank you for asking us to be here.
            <br />
            Today, my colleague, Rupert Andrews, and I will present our recommendations.
            <br />
            We'll discuss how Belle Vie can improve its competitive position.
            <br />
            RUPERT: Before we begin, we want to thank everyone at Belle Vie who has helped us with our research.
            <br />
            Your input has been very valuable throughout this project.
            <br />
            KENJI: We'll begin by looking at Belle Vie's current market position.
            <br />
            THEN WE'LL PRESENT A RISK-RETURN ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY'S OPTIONS IN THREE AREAS: existing fragrances, new fragrances, and nonfragrances.
            <br />
            Finally, after we've discussed these options, we'll outline our recommendations for future steps.
            <br />
            RUPERT: First, let's talk about where you stand in the women's fragrance market today.
            <br />
            In many ways, Belle Vie is in an excellent market position.
            <br />
            The company and its flagship product ―L'Amour― are highly respected worldwide.
            <br />
            The company's strong brand equity is one of its greatest assets.
            <br />
            KENJI: At the same time, the women's fragrance market is changing in ways that aren't favorable for Belle Vie.
            <br />
            This market segment is becoming more fragmented because of new products and competitors.
            <br />
            Until you make changes in your marketing strategy,
            <br />
            you'll continue to lose market share.
            <br />
            RUPERT: Now, let's consider the risks and potential returns of each option.
            <br />
            Take a look at this chart while we explain it.
            <br />
            First, let's discuss the fragrance market.
            <br />
            KENJI: As you can see, adjusting the strategy for your existing flagship product―L'Amour―is a low-risk, low-return option.
            <br />
            On the other hand, launching a new women's fragrance presents a medium-risk, medium-return option, and a new men's fragrance presents a higher risk.
            <br />
            FINALLY, LET'S MOVE ON TO THE THIRD OPTION: the non-fragrance market.
            <br />
            RUPERT: We believe that this category offers high potential returns for Belle Vie.
            <br />
            In our opinion, the company has three options in the non-fragrance market.
            <br />
            One, you could license the Belle Vie name to a company that makes high-quality accessories or cosmetics.
            <br />
            Two, you could bring in design experts and develop a new line of accessories or cosmetics.
            <br />
            And three, you could acquire a small manufacturer that has high-quality products but limited distribution.
            <br />
            KENJI: So, are there any questions before we make our final recommendations?
            <br />


            NARRATOR: 在前面的情节里，顾问专家 Kenji Watanabe 和 Rupert Andrews 在准备他们关于 Belle Vie 的可能选择的发言报告。
            <br />
            现在他们将对 Belle Vie 的资深管理层作汇报发言。
            <br />
            KENJI: 好，让我们开始吧。
            <br />
            下午好，感谢各位邀请我们参加这个会议。
            <br />
            今天，我和我的同事 Rupert Andrews 将提出我们的建议。
            <br />
            我们将讨论 Belle Vie 可以怎样提高它的竞争地位。
            <br />
            RUPERT: 在我开始之前，我们想感谢为我们的调查提供协助的每一个 Belle Vie 职员。<br />

            您们在整个调查过程中所提供的材料和意见是非常有价值的。<br />

            KENJI: 我们将先看一看 Belle Vie 的现有市场地位。<br />

            然后，我们将对公司在现有香水、新款香水和非香水类产品三个领域中的可能选择作风险－回报的分析。<br />

            讨论完这些可能选择后，我们最后会概括我们对未来发展的建议。<br />

            RUPERT: 首先，让我们谈谈您们在今天女用香水市场中的位置。<br />

            在许多方面，Belle Vie 正处于极好的市场位置。<br />

            公司及其王牌产品 L'Amour 在世界各地都受到高度的尊重。<br />

            公司的优秀名牌商标值是公司最大的资产之一。<br />

            KENJI: 但与此同时，女用香水市场却正朝着不利于 Belle Vie 的方向改变。<br />

            由于有新的产品和新的竞争者，这部分市场正在变得更加支离破碎。<br />

            如果您们不改变您们的市场策略，您们将会继续失去您们的市场占有率。<br />

            RUPERT: 这是真的。<br />

            现在让我们考虑每个选择的风险及可能的回报。<br />

            请看这张图表，我们将逐项解释。<br />

            首先，让我们讨论香水市场。<br />

            KENJI: 可以看出，调整现有旗舰产品“L'Amour”的战略是一个低风险、低回报的备选方法。<br />

            而在另一方面，我们看到，开发新款女用香水呈现为中等风险和中等回报的选 择，开发新的男用香水则呈现为高风险的选择。<br />

            最后，让我们看看第三种选择：非香水类产品市场。<br />

            RUPERT: 我们相信这个种类很有可能会给 Belle Vie 带来高的回报。<br />

            我们认为，公司在非香水市场中有三项备选战略。<br />

            第一，您们可以将 Belle Vie 的品牌有条件地转让生产高质量装饰品或化妆品的公司使用。<br />

            第二，您们可以请设计专家开发新的饰品或化妆品产品。<br />

            第三，您们可以并购一家生产高质量产品，但分销面有限的小型工厂。<br />

            KENJI: 在我们总结我们的最后建议之前，请问各位有没有问题？<br />

            NARRATOR: Kenji Watanabe and Rupert Andrews have presented their analysis of Belle Vie's options.
            <br />
            Now they are making recommendations to the Belle Vie executives.
            <br />
            KENJI: Now that we've discussed Belle Vie's market position, and the possible risks and returns for the company, we'd like to make our recommendations.
            <br />
            Our strategy for L'Amour is probably our most important point.
            <br />
            L'Amour helped establish Belle Vie as a top-tier company, and in many countries around the world the fragrance is a household name.
            <br />
            RUPERT: Because L'Amour is so well known already, we recommend only small changes in advertising and marketing to increase sales.
            <br />
            Big changes could jeopardize L'Amour's current customer base.
            <br />
            KENJI: As for the new fragrances, we recommend that you move forward with a men's fragrance―but slowly.
            <br />
            Test it in a limited market.
            <br />
            This will give you the opportunity to refine the product and marketing plan before trying a full launch.
            <br />
            RUPERT: We also recommend that you focus attention on the younger women's fragrance market since women's fragrances are your area of expertise.
            <br />
            Our market research shows that younger women want a fragrance that's more youthful and exciting than L'Amour.
            <br />
            KENJI: Finally, regarding the third category―the nonfragrance market―we recommend two possible options.
            <br />
            Since the Belle Vie name is very valuable, you should license the name to another company that produces high-quality cosmetics or accessories.
            <br />
            This would provide a steady income at little or no cost.
            <br />
            RUPERT: At the same time, start talking with investment banks about the possibility of acquiring a small, high-quality accessories company.
            <br />
            The right company could help Belle Vie successfully enter the younger female market.
            <br />
            KENJI: Whichever plan you choose, many other issues may come up.
            <br />
            Of course, we'd welcome the opportunity to work with you in the future.
            <br />
            Well, I think that covers everything.
            <br />
            Now, we'd like to answer any questions you might have.
            <br />
            BERNARD: First, let me thank you both for a very interesting and useful presentation.
            <br />
            Could you say a little more about what specific changes we should make in our marketing and advertising strategy for L'Amour?
            <br />
            KENJI: Sure. We think that Belle Vie should focus more on in-store promotions―especially in the department stores where your customers shop.
            <br />
            You should freshen up the ad campaign and advertise in a wider variety of women's magazines, and also expand your online advertising.
            <br />
            Emphasize the reputation of the brand.
            <br />
            Any other questions?
            <br />
            No? Well, that's it.
            <br />
            Thank you very much for your time, and we hope to work with Belle Vie moving forward.
            <br />


            NARRATOR: Kenji Watanabe 和 Rupert Andrews 已经提出了他们对 Belle Vie 的可能选择的分析。
            <br />
            现在他们正在向 Belle Vie 的总经理们提建议。
            <br />
            KENJI: 前面我们已经讨论了 Belle Vie 的可能选择及其可能给公司带来的风险和回报。现在，我们想说说我们的建议。
            <br />
            我们的 L'Amour 策略可能是我们最重要的观点。
            <br />
            L'Amour 帮助 Belle Vie 建立了高级公司的形象，并使它的香水在世界上许多国家成为家喻户晓的名字。
            <br />
            RUPERT: 因为 L'Amour 已经非常著名，我们建议在广告和推销上作小的改进以增加销售。
            <br />
            大的改变可能会危害 L'Amour 的现有顾客群。
            <br />
            KENJI: 至于新香水，我们建议以后推出男士香水，但要慢慢来。
            <br />
            先在较小的市场里试验。
            <br />
            这样做会让您们在全面推广之前有机会改进产品和市场计划。
            <br />
            RUPERT: 我们还建议您们将重点放在年轻女性香水市场，因为女用香水是您们精熟的领域。
            <br />
            我们的调查显示，年轻女性想要比 L'Amour 年轻和刺激的香水。
            <br />
            KENJI: 最后，关于第三类，非香水类产品市场，我们提出两种可能的选择建议。
            <br />
            因为 Belle Vie 的名字非常有价值，您们应该将名字租赁，租给另一家生产优质化妆品或饰品的公司使用。
            <br />
            这样做将为公司提供低成本或无成本的稳定收入。
            <br />
            RUPERT: 与此同时，开始与投资银行谈收购一家生产优质饰品的小型公司的可能性。
            <br />
            合适的公司可以帮助 Belle Vie 成功地切入年轻女性的市场。
            <br />
            KENJI: 无论您选择哪一种计划，都可能会伴随出现许多其它问题。
            <br />
            当然，我们欢迎在未来跟您们一起工作的机会。
            <br />
            好，我想我们要说的就是这些。
            <br />
            现在，我想回答您们可能有的任何问题。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 首先，让我感谢二位非常有趣和有用的演讲。
            <br />
            您能不能对我们在 L'Amour 的推销和广告策略方面应该作什么样的具体改进再说详细一些的意见？
            <br />
            KENJI: 当然可以。我们认为 Belle Vie 应该重点加强店内宣传，特别是在您们顾客购货的百货商店内的宣传。
            <br />
            应该在更多的女性杂志中更新广告大片并刊登广告，而且还要扩大在线广告规模。
            <br />
            强调品牌的声誉。
            <br />
            有没有其它问题？
            <br />
            不行？ 嗯，就这样吧。
            <br />
            非常感谢你所花的时间，我们希望以后与 Belle Vie 合作。
            <br />

            NARRATOR: Watch as Kenji calls the concierge to ask for advice about his missing briefcase.
            <br />
            KENJI: Yes, the concierge's desk, please.
            <br />
            Hello, this is Kenji Watanabe in the Concorde Suite.
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: Good afternoon, Mr.Watanabe.
            <br />
            How may I help you?
            <br />
            KENJI: I just noticed that my briefcase is missing, and I'm due to leave Paris in a couple of hours.
            <br />
            I'm in a real bind and I was hoping you could help.
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: Of course.
            <br />
            Perhaps you should retrace your steps.
            <br />
            When did you have it last?
            <br />
            KENJI: Well, I remember having it with me at breakfast this morning.
            <br />
            To be honest, I don't know if I misplaced it or if someone stole it.
            <br />
            Should I call the police and report it missing?
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: Yes, you could do that.
            <br />
            But first, I'll check the hotel lost and found.
            <br />
            Are there any items in the briefcase that you need for your trip home today?
            <br />
            KENJI: Yes! Everything I need is in the briefcase―my credit cards, my passport...
            <br />
            What should I do?
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: Why don't you call your credit card company?
            <br />
            They'll close your account.
            <br />
            As for the passport, I'd recommend calling the consulate immediately.
            <br />
            KENJI: Okay, I'll do that. And should I try getting a later flight so that―uh, excuse me a second, I have a call on my cell.
            <br />
            Hello, Rupert.
            <br />
            RUPERT: Hi, Kenji.
            <br />
            I was just finishing up in the health club, and they told me that you'd left your briefcase there.
            <br />
            I have it right here with me.
            <br />
            KENJI: Oh, thank you! I'm so relieved!
            <br />
            I really should keep an eye on my possessions.
            <br />
            Well, I'll see you here in a few minutes.
            <br />
            Our flight leaves in a couple of hours.


            <br />
            NARRATOR: 观察 Kenji 打电话给服务台询问他丢失的公文包。
            <br />
            KENJI: 请接服务台。
            <br />
            您好，我是住在 Concorde 套房的 Kenji Watanabe。
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: 午安，Watanabe 先生。
            <br />
            我能帮您做点儿什么？
            <br />
            KENJI: 是这样。我刚发现我的公文包不见了，而且我再过两个小时就要离开巴黎。
            <br />
            我不知道该怎么办，所以我希望您可以帮忙。
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: 当然可以。
            <br />
            您也许应该回到您去过的地方去找。
            <br />
            您最后看见它是什么时候？
            <br />
            KENJI: 我记得今天早上吃早饭时还带着它。
            <br />
            老实说，我不知道是我放错地方了，还是有人把它偷走了。
            <br />
            我是不是应该打电话给警察报失?
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: 是，您可以那样做。
            <br />
            但是，先让我问一下酒店失物招领处。
            <br />
            公文包里有没有您今天旅行需要的东西。
            <br />
            KENJI: 有！我需要的东西全在公文包里，我的机票、我的信用卡，还有我的护照。
            <br />
            我该怎么办呢？
            <br />
            CONCIERGE: 为什么不往信用卡公司打电话？
            <br />
            他们会关闭你的帐户。
            <br />
            至于护照，我建议您马上打电话给领事馆。
            <br />
            KENJI: 好吧，我会给他们打电话。 我是不是应该尽量搭晚点儿的航班，这样，嗯，对不起，稍等，我手机来电话了。
            <br />
            喂？
            <br />
            RUPERT: 你好，Kenji。
            <br />
            我刚在健身俱乐部结束健身，他们就告诉我你把手提箱落那儿了。
            <br />
            手提箱在我这儿。
            <br />
            哦，谢谢！ 这样我就放心了！
            <br />
            我真得看好自己的东西。
            <br />
            嗯，几分钟后我就能在这儿看到你。
            <br />
            我们的航班几个小时后就要出发了。<br />

        <p>
            NARRATOR: Previously, Rupert Andrews and Kenji Watanabe presented their recommendations to the executives at Belle Vie.
            <br />
            Isabelle Rollette and Bernard Valence are discussing the options―creating a young women's fragrance, a men's fragrance, or a new accessories line.
            <br />
            What do you think they will decide to do?
            <br />
            BERNARD: I'm excited about making changes at Belle Vie, but I'm surprised that the consultants recommended all three options.
            <br />
            I'm opposed to launching three new products at once.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: But Bernard, we can easily find the resources to finance all three options.
            <br />
            We won't have a problem getting a loan.
            <br />
            BERNARD: Right.
            <br />
            Getting more money isn't an obstacle.
            <br />
            But the board wants to see results within the next six months.
            <br />
            If we spread ourselves too thin, we'll set ourselves up for failure.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: Okay, so perhaps we should just focus on one option.
            <br />
            In that case, which one are you interested in pursuing?
            <br />
            BERNARD: Well, the consultants' research shows that the number of men buying cologne is increasing worldwide.
            <br />
            Therefore, I'd opt to concentrate on the men's fragrance, not the women's fragrance.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: On the other hand, Belle Vie is familiar with women's needs and buying patterns.
            <br />
            We've never offered a men's product.
            <br />
            We'd have to do a lot more research on the men's fragrance market.
            <br />
            BERNARD: Even so, we're not experts on the young women's market.
            <br />
            We'd have to do more research on that, too.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: But in the long run, if more young women become Belle Vie customers, we can continue to offer them a variety of products as they get older.
            <br />
            BERNARD: That's true.
            <br />
            The key is to catch them when they're young.
            <br />
            But we've already done so much research for the men's line.
            <br />
            We've even announced that we're going to introduce a new men's fragrance.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: Then again, maybe we should cut our losses and focus on the new women's fragrance.
            <br />
            We don't have to stick with our original plan.
            <br />
            Look at it this way.
            <br />
            We still have to research the younger women's market, but I think that will take less time and energy than continuing to pursue a completely new market.
            <br />
            BERNARD: That's a good point.
            <br />
            I think it would be best for the company at this time.
            <br />
            We should also think about licensing our name to an accessories manufacturer.
            <br />
            That seems to be the most cost-effective way to add to our existing accessories line.
            <br />
            As the consultants pointed out, we could earn a good profit without investing much money.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: I agree.
            <br />
            Let's discuss these ideas with Jean-Luc and Simone at our meeting tomorrow.
            <br />


            NARRATOR: 前面，Rupert Andrews 和 Kenji Watanabe 已经将他们的建议向 Belle Vie 的总经理们作了回报。
            <br />
            Isabelle Rollette 和 Bernard Valence 正在讨论相关项目：开发年轻女性香水，男用香水或新饰品系列。
            <br />
            您认为他们会做什么样的决定？
            <br />
            BERNARD: 我对在 Belle Vie 内进行改革深感兴奋，但我很惊讶咨询顾问会推荐所有的三种选择。
            <br />
            我反对同时开发三种新产品。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 可是，Bernard，我们可以很容易找到资助所有三种选择的资金。
            <br />
            我们不会有贷不到款的问题。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 对。
            <br />
            多挣钱并不难。
            <br />
            但董事会想在未来六个月内看到效果。
            <br />
            如果我们把摊子铺得过大，我们会自寻失败。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 所以，我们也许应该只将精力集中在一个项目上。
            <br />
            如果是那样，您对实施哪个项目感兴趣？
            <br />
            BERNARD: 我想，咨询顾问的调查显示世界各地购买哥龙香水的男性数量正在增加。
            <br />
            所以，我倾向于把精力放在男用香水上，而不是在女用香水上面。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 但是，Belle Vie 熟悉女性的需要和购物习惯。
            <br />
            我们从未提供男用产品。
            <br />
            我们必须对男用香水市场做更多、更广泛的调查。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 虽然如此，但我们对年轻女性的市场也不熟悉。
            <br />
            我们也必须对该市场做更多的调查。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 但从长远的角度看，如果有更多的年轻女性成为 Belle Vie 的顾客，我们可以在她们年龄比较大时，继续为她们提供多样化的产品。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 那倒不错。
            <br />
            关键是在她们年轻的时候抓住她们。
            <br />
            可是我们已经在男用产品上做了那么多的调查研究。
            <br />
            我们甚至已经宣布我们将推出新的男用香水。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 那么还是那样，我们也许应该减少我们的损失，而将精力集中在新的女用香水上面。
            <br />
            我们用不着非得吊在我们最初的计划上面。
            <br />
            我们应该这么看。
            <br />
            我们虽然仍必须调查年轻女性的市场，但是我认为它所需要的时间和精力会比继续开发一个全新的市场所需要的少。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 这一点很有道理。
            <br />
            我认为它目前对公司来说是最佳选择。
            <br />
            我们也应该考虑将我们的名字发照租给一家饰品厂商使用。
            <br />
            它看来是增加我们现有饰品的最合算的方法。
            <br />
            正如咨询顾问所指出的，我们可以不用投资很多钱就可以获得很好的利润。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 我同意。
            <br />
            让我们明天开会时把这些想法跟 Jean-Luc 和 Simone 讨论一下。<br />

            NARRATOR: Previously, the executives at Belle Vie reached a decision to diversify their line of accessories.
            <br />
            Two months later, Bernard Valence and Isabelle Rollette of Belle Vie are meeting with Nikos Manolas of Naxos Optical, a Greek sunglasses manufacturer.
            <br />
            NIKOS: I appreciate the opportunity to further discuss our licensing agreement with Belle Vie.
            <br />
            You told me on the phone that you might consider an exclusive arrangement.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: Yes.
            <br />
            A long-term relationship with a manufacturer could be key to our success in this market.
            <br />
            We're not planning to allow the use of the Belle Vie name by any other sunglass manufacturers.
            <br />
            NIKOS: Good, I'm happy to hear that.
            <br />
            Would you consider making the initial agreement for a three-year period?
            <br />
            BERNARD: Actually, we think a two-year contract would be long enough for us to judge the success of the arrangement.
            <br />
            Then we'd have the option to renew if sales are good.
            <br />
            NIKOS: Well, that sounds reasonable.
            <br />
            Now, I've brought some sketches of the designs we talked about.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: These look very stylish.
            <br />
            I especially like this design―I'd wear glasses like these myself.
            <br />
            NIKOS: Thanks! We gave the glasses a youthful but sophisticated look, as you wanted.
            <br />
            We considered wire frames, but these thick plastic frames are making a big comeback.
            <br />
            BERNARD: And these are high-end glasses?
            <br />
            We'll only consider attaching our name to a product that meets our standards of quality.
            <br />
            NIKOS: Oh, yes.
            <br />
            We've designed these sunglasses to meet the highest standards.
            <br />
            They're exactly what smart consumers look for―in addition to their high-fashion look, they're durable, comfortable, and practical.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: Good.
            <br />
            We look forward to seeing a prototype.
            <br />
            We'd like to sign off on the final design as soon as possible.
            <br />
            Would it be possible to get us a prototype early next week?
            <br />
            NIKOS: I don't know... we might need a little more time. But we can definitely get it to you by the end of next week.
            <br />
            BERNARD: Okay, that's acceptable.
            <br />
            Now, I think we're close to having a deal.
            <br />
            Should we take this time to discuss the issue of royalties?
            <br />
            NIKOS: That's a good idea.
            <br />
            Did the figures we shared last week seem close?
            <br />
            BERNARD: Uh, yes, they were close. But we'd like you to consider something closer to 22 percent rather than 18 percent.
            <br />
            NIKOS: I see. We might agree to that.
            <br />
            I'll have a closer look at the numbers and get back to you.
            <br />


            NARRATOR: 在此以前，Belle Vie 的领导们已决定要增加他们的服饰产品种类。
            <br />
            两个月后，Belle Vie 的 Bernard Valence 和 Isabelle Rollette 正在与一家希腊太阳眼镜生产商 Naxos Optical 的 Nikos Manolas 举行会谈。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 我很高兴能有机会与 Belle Vie 公司进一步讨论我们的使用许可合同问题。
            <br />
            您在电话上告诉我，你们可能会考虑一个独家专用的安排。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 是。
            <br />
            与制造商建立长期关系，可能是我们在这个市场中获得成功的关键。
            <br />
            我们不打算允许其他太阳镜制造商使用名称“Belle Vie”。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 我很高兴听您这么说。
            <br />
            您是否可考虑签一个为期3年的首期合同？
            <br />
            BERNARD: 我们觉得2年期合同就足以让我们判断这种安排能否成功。
            <br />
            如果销售很好，我们有续约的选择权。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 这很合情理。
            <br />
            好，我带来一些我们谈过的设计草图。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 这种设计看来非常时髦。
            <br />
            我特别喜欢这种款式，我自己就愿意戴相似的眼镜。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 正如您希望的，我们把眼镜设计为既显年轻又显成熟。
            <br />
            我们原先考虑用金属丝框架，但这些厚塑料框架正在重新风行。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 而且这是一种高档的眼镜是不是？
            <br />
            我们将只考虑把我们的商标贴在符合我们质量标准的产品上。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 那当然。
            <br />
            我们设计这种太阳眼镜以符合最高的标准。
            <br />
            它们正好是聪明的消费者所需要的，它们除了有非常时髦的外表，而且还有耐 用、舒适和实用的特点。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 很好。
            <br />
            我们等着看样品原型。
            <br />
            我们想尽快敲定最终的式样。
            <br />
            能不能在下周一开始的时候给我们弄个样品？
            <br />
            NIKOS: 我我不知道……我们需要的时间可能多一点儿。 但我们一定能在下周周末给你弄到手。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 行。
            <br />
            那么，我想我们接近达成协议了。
            <br />
            我们现在是否应该谈谈特许使用费的问题？
            <br />
            NIKOS: 好啊。
            <br />
            上周我们给你的数字看起来差不多吧？
            <br />
            BERNARD: 嗯，是差不多。 但我们想让你考虑的是接近 22% 而不是 18% 的比例。
            <br />
            NIKOS: 我明白了。 我们可以同意这么办。
            <br />
            我要祝 Bernard 50 岁生日快乐！<br />

            Belle Vie<br />
            87 rue de la Croix<br />
            75343 Paris, France<br />
            Dear Ms. Rollette:
            <br />
            Thank you for your inquiry about arranging a(n) (1) licensing agreement between our companies. We at Leuttens-Worf are truly excited by the possibility of establishing a close relationship with a company such as Belle Vie.
            <br />
            The attached report contains the details of our offer. For your convenience, I will summarize the main points here:
            <br />
            As you might expect, we would like a(n) (2) exclusive contract for eyewear--no other company should be licensed to make Belle Vie sunglasses.
            <br />
            We would like a contract period of at least three years, with an option to (3) renew the agreement for another three years after that. We feel that a long-term contract would benefit both companies.
            <br />
            You will find sketches and details of some initial designs on page 14 of the report. The look of the glasses is both (4) fashionable and sporty. That is, we have designed them to appeal to consumers who are stylish but also lead active lives.
            <br />
            Financial information is in section three of the report, beginning on page 22. In short, we are willing to pay 16 percent of sales as (5) royalties. In addition, we are asking you to contribute half of the total marketing costs. Of course, we will need to work closely together to sell the new line.
            <br />
            We think you will find this to be an attractive offer. Please don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions. I (6) look forward to your reply.
            <br />
            Very truly yours,<br />
            Karel Huys<br />
            Director of Corporate Licensing<br />
            <br />
            Karel Huys, Director<br />
            Corporate Licensing Section<br />

            Avenue Cesar, 35/37<br />
            B-1000 Brussels, Belgium<br />

            Dear Mr. Huys:
            <br />
            Thank you for the thorough explanation of your offer concerning our new line of sunglasses. We know that Leuttens-Worf has a (7) prestigious reputation, and your products are highly regarded in the industry. Unfortunately, after much careful thought, we have selected another company to produce Belle Vie sunglasses.
            <br />
            The main reason for our decision is the design. We feel your designs are excellent for a line of sportswear. Many of the (8) features of your glasses, such as curved lenses and head straps, are suitable for a young and active market. We want our sunglasses to be a (9) high-end product that will sell at a higher price to a more sophisticated consumer. For this reason, the sunglasses must have an elegant image, like the entire line of Belle Vie accessories. We think your glasses are (10) tastefully designed and look stylish, but are too casual for our market.
            <br />
            This was a very difficult decision for us. Perhaps we will have the opportunity to work together in the future.
            <br />
            Very truly yours,
            <br />

            NARRATOR: Belle Vie recently launched a new perfume and a line of sunglasses.
            <br />
            Now, a large group of Belle Vie employees has come together at the Grand Parc Hotel for Bernard's 50th birthday party.
            <br />
            SIMONE: Happy birthday, Bernard.
            <br />
            BERNARD: Thanks, Simone.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: This is wonderful!
            <br />
            I love the festive atmosphere!
            <br />
            The balloons, the lights…
            <br />
            SIMONE: Oh…I think Sophie's about to speak.
            <br />
            SOPHIE: Could I have everyone's attention please?
            <br />
            I'd like to wish Bernard a happy 50th birthday!
            <br />
            Bernard, may you have many more years as CEO of Belle Vie.
            <br />
            Your leadership has brought us through a very difficult time.
            <br />
            ISABELLE: I'd also like to wish Bernard a happy birthday and congratulate him on the great job he's done.
            <br />
            Twelve months ago, things were looking bad for Belle Vie.
            <br />
            But with a little teamwork, and with Bernard as our leader, we've really turned things around.
            <br />
            Bernard, thanks to your leadership and the power of teamwork, Belle Vie's future looks bright!
            <br />
            BERNARD: Thank you, Isabelle.
            <br />
            And now, if you all don't mind, I'd like to say a few words about this past year.
            <br />
            We were in a difficult situation, but we met the challenge.
            <br />
            We found effective answers to our problems and now things are looking up.
            <br />
            Our company is changing swiftly.
            <br />
            Naxos Optical will manufacture a new line of Belle Vie sunglasses.
            <br />
            And today, we began selling Fleur de Bali, our new women's perfume, in stores all over Europe.
            <br />
            Launching these new products is a great way to celebrate a birthday.
            <br />
            But I think the real gift is having a group of employees as hardworking as this one.
            <br />
            Thank you for everything you've done to create a new Belle Vie.
            <br />
            You're a fantastic team, and I look forward to many more successful ventures together!


            <br />
            NARRATOR: Belle Vie 最近推出一种新香水和一种太阳眼镜系列。
            <br />
            现在，一大群 Belle Vie 职员汇集在 Grand Parc 酒店参加 Bernard 的50岁生日晚会。
            <br />
            SIMONE: Bernard，生日快乐。
            <br />
            BERNARD: 谢谢您，Simone。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 这真是好极了！
            <br />
            我喜欢这种喜庆的气氛！
            <br />
            这气球，这灯光！
            <br />
            SIMONE: 哦，我想 Sophie 就要讲话了。
            <br />
            SOPHIE: 我能不能请各位静一下？
            <br />
            我要祝 Bernard 50 岁生日快乐！
            <br />
            Bernard，但愿你继续长期担任 Belle Vie 首席执行官。
            <br />
            在你的领导下，我们挺过了困难时期。
            <br />
            ISABELLE: 我还要祝 Bernard 生日快乐，并祝贺他取得的卓越成就。
            <br />
            12个月前，Belle Vie 的形势看起来非常不妙。
            <br />
            但通过大家的努力和 Bernard 的领导，我们已经从根本上改变了局面。
            <br />
            Bernard，多亏你的领导和团队协作的力量，Belle Vie 的未来一片光明！
            <br />
            BERNARD: 谢谢您，Isabelle。
            <br />
            如果你们不介意，我想乘此机会对我们过去的一年说几句话。
            <br />
            我们曾经遇到困难，但我们向困难迎战。
            <br />
            我们找到了解决问题的有效方法，而现在情况正在好转。
            <br />
            我们公司正在迅速改变。
            <br />
            Naxos Optical 将生产一套新的 Belle Vie 太阳眼镜系列。
            <br />
            而且今天，我们已开始在全欧洲的商店里销售我们新的女用香水 Fleur de Bali。
            <br />
            推出这些新产品是庆祝我生日的极好的方式。
            <br />
            但是我认为，最珍贵的礼物是我有在座各位这样一些工作努力的员工 。
            <br />
            感谢你们为创造新 Belle Vie 所作出的每一项努力。
            <br />

            NARRATOR: Two friends, Anna and Michele, are meeting at an outdoor cafe in Paris.
            <br />
            Michele is French.
            <br />
            Anna is British and has just relocated from her advertising agency's branch office in Manchester, England, to its headquarters in Paris.
            <br />
            MICHELE: Anna, it's so good to see you again!
            <br />
            It's been almost a year, hasn't it?
            <br />
            ANNA: Yes, it has.
            <br />
            You cut your hair!
            <br />
            It looks great, Michele.
            <br />
            MICHELE: Thanks!
            <br />
            You look wonderful, too.
            <br />
            Hey, congratulations on your promotion to creative director!
            <br />
            I'm glad your advertising agency moved you to Paris.
            <br />
            ANNA: Well, I've been trying to relocate here for a while.
            <br />
            Fortunately, the agency needed someone to be in charge of the international ad campaigns here in Paris, and I got the job.
            <br />
            MICHELE: That's great!
            <br />
            Hey, you're wearing Belle Vie's Flair sunglasses, aren't you?
            <br />
            What happened to the ones you used to wear?
            <br />
            You remember...the ones with mirrored lenses?
            <br />
            ANNA: Of course I do!
            <br />
            I finally got rid of them.
            <br />
            I'm also wearing Belle Vie's new fragrance, Fleur de Bali.
            <br />
            Kind of exotic, isn't it?
            <br />
            The scent is made from Indonesian flowers.
            <br />
            MICHELE: Hmm, it suits you well.
            <br />
            I've heard Fleur de Bali is really popular now.
            <br />
            So, tell me, how do you like living in Paris?
            <br />
            ANNA: Well, the food, the culture, and the people are all great.
            <br />
            But, you know, I still haven't gotten used to how stylish everybody is in Paris.
            <br />
            It's very different from Manchester.
            <br />
            MICHELE: That's why you picked up those new sunglasses and that wonderful perfume, isn't it?
            <br />
            ANNA: Actually, I bought Fleur de Bali because I'm hooked on Belle Vie's new TV commercials.
            <br />
            Have you seen them?
            <br />
            They use short pieces from old movies with stars like Brigitte Bardot and Audrey Hepburn.
            <br />
            I'd like to use a similar concept in one of my new ad campaigns.
            <br />
            MICHELE: That sounds like a good idea.
            <br />
            You know, it's funny.
            <br />
            Everyone used to think of Belle Vie as kind of out of touch.
            <br />
            But now their image is pretty hip and sophisticated.
            <br />
            Maybe it's time for me to get some Belle Vie sunglasses too, huh?
            <br />
            ANNA: Sure.
            <br />
            All of the department stores have them, or you can get them online, from Belle Vie's website.
            <br />
            MICHELE: I think I will.
            <br />
            Oh, there's our waiter. Let's order.
            <br />


            NARRATOR: 两位朋友，Anna 和 Michele，正在巴黎一家露天小餐馆碰面。
            <br />
            Michele 是法国人。
            <br />
            Anna 是英国人，刚刚从她工作的广告公司在英国曼彻斯特的分部调到巴黎的总部工作。
            <br />
            MICHELE: Anna，再次见到您真让我十分高兴！
            <br />
            差不多快1年没见了，是不是？
            <br />
            ANNA: 是，没错。
            <br />
            您剪头发了！
            <br />
            挺好看的，Michele。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 谢谢！
            <br />
            您看上去也挺好的。
            <br />
            嗨，恭喜您提升为创作主任。
            <br />
            我很高兴您的广告公司把您派到巴黎来。
            <br />
            ANNA: 是这样，我想着要移居到这里来已经有好一阵子了。
            <br />
            碰巧公司需要有人负责巴黎这里的国际广告制作，所以我就得到了这份工作。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 真是太好了！
            <br />
            嗨，您戴的是 Belle Vie 的 Flair 牌太阳眼镜是不是？
            <br />
            你过去戴的太阳镜怎么样了？
            <br />
            你记不记得……有反光镜片的太阳镜？
            <br />
            ANNA: 我当然记得！
            <br />
            当我买到这副新眼镜时，我终于把它淘汰掉了。
            <br />
            我身上还用了 Belle Vie 的新香水 Fleur de Bali 呢。
            <br />
            有点儿异国情调是不是？
            <br />
            这种香水由印度尼西亚花朵制成。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 嗯，它挺适合您的。
            <br />
            我听说 Fleur de Bali 现在非常流行。
            <br />
            好了，请告诉我，您住在巴黎的感觉怎么样？
            <br />
            ANNA: 这里的人、文化和饮食都挺好的。
            <br />
            可是，您知道，我还不习惯巴黎人个个都那么时髦。
            <br />
            它跟曼彻斯特很不一样。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 那就是您为什么买那副新太阳眼镜和那种奇妙香水的原因是不是？
            <br />
            ANNA: 事实上，我买 Fleur de Bali 是因为我被 Belle Vie 的新电视广告迷住了。
            <br />
            您看过他们的广告吗？
            <br />
            他们用了 Brigitte Bardot 和 Audrey Hepburn 等大明星演的老电影片断。
            <br />
            我想在我的一个新广告里也用类似的创意。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 听起来挺不错的。
            <br />
            您知道吗，说来还很有趣。
            <br />
            大家原来都把 Belle Vie 看成落伍的公司。
            <br />
            可现在他们的形像却非常新派和不落俗套。
            <br />
            也许我也该买一些 Belle Vie 太阳眼镜了，对吗？
            <br />
            ANNA: 当然。
            <br />
            所有百货商店都有售，也可在 Belle Vie 的网站在线购买。
            <br />
            MICHELE: 我想我会的。
            <br />
            哦，我们的服务员来了，我们点菜吧。
            <br />

            Greetings Michele,
            <br />
            I'm so happy that I've (1) relocated to Paris. I was so bored in Manchester. I really like my new apartment building here because it's so international. My neighbors come from all over the world! Speaking of my new building, I have an embarrassing story to tell you.
            <br />
            Last week, I met my next-door neighbor from Japan, Mr. Suzuki. I decided that it would be appropriate to greet him by (2) bowing. I don't think he appreciated my attempt at a Japanese greeting, however, because he didn't bow back. Instead he used the usual international (3) gesture for meeting new people--he put out his hand for me to shake. I didn't realize that I'm so (4) out of touch with proper greeting customs. I guess I don't know as much about Japanese culture as I thought I did!
            <br />
            In the end, everything worked out just fine. I saw Mr. Suzuki the next day and he gave me a small gift to welcome me to Paris. It's a lovely scarf made of blue silk, and the color really (5) suits me well. Everyone says the blue scarf looks great with that dark blue dress I wore the day we met for coffee.
            <br />
            Let's go shopping this weekend for the new Belle Vie sunglasses that you wanted. Give your mother a big (6) hug for me. She's such a sweet woman!
            <br />
            See you soon, <br />
            Anna
            <br />
            <br />
            Hello Anna,
            <br />
            Your story about Mr. Suzuki was funny. Let me give you a little piece of advice. I know a successful businesswoman like you doesn't need a (7) tip from me, but here's my suggestion: Don't worry about it! At least you didn't (8) embrace him. Can you imagine the look on his face if you had put your arms around a total stranger and given him a big hug? I'm sure Mr. Suzuki knows you were only trying to be polite.
            <br />
            I would love to get together with you this weekend. Yes, let's go shopping so I can (9) pick up some more Fleur de Bali perfume. I've been completely (10) hooked on Fleur de Bali since I started seeing those new TV ads you mentioned. I use it all the time now!
            <br />
            Let's go to that (11) hip new perfume and body shop around the corner from your apartment building. After that, I'd like to go to one of the department stores so I can buy a new pair of Flair sunglasses. I really want to (12) get rid of my ugly old pair. Actually, I wish I could throw them in the garbage right now.
            <br />
            I'll call you tomorrow to arrange a time and place to meet.
            <br />
            Until Saturday,<br />
            Michele<br />
